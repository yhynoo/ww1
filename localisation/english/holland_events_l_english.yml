  # antwerp
  holland_antwerp.1.d: "A quiet but urgent delegation has arrived from [HOL.GetNameDef], proposing a dramatic shift in the region's future. We are told unrest in Vlaanderen and Antwerpen is growing unmanageable under Dutch rule, and some in their cabinet now believe only French oversight can restore stability.\n\nThey request our swift assumption of control over the territory, invoking old promises and shared interests."

  holland_antwerp.2.d: "Following discreet diplomatic negotiations, [HOL.GetNameDef] has formally transferred the administration of Vlaanderen to France. Officials in Paris describe the move as a stabilizing measure, while the rest of Europe watches with wary eyes.\n\nThe Netherlands, struggling with unrest and internal division, now turns inward to face the consequences of this bold decision."

  holland_antwerp.3.d: "Despite the Dutch appeal, [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused to intervene in Vlaanderen. The rejection deals a heavy blow to the moderate faction in The Hague and emboldens nationalist hardliners.\n\nWith tensions mounting, questions now swirl about whether the Netherlands can hold onto the rest of its southern provinces."

  # eindhoven
  holland_eindhoven.1.d: "The influx of Wallonian refugees into North Brabant, particularly Eindhoven and its surroundings, has triggered a profound humanitarian and economic challenge. Some industrialists have proposed investing their own capital to harness this unexpected labor force, but critics fear such efforts would lack coordination and social oversight.\n\nA government-backed fund could channel these efforts productively — or risk fueling tensions even further."

  holland_eindhoven.2.d: "Thanks to a combination of government support and private initiative, many Wallonian refugees have found work in the Limburg and Brabant mining sectors.\n\nTheir technical knowledge and willingness to accept difficult conditions have contributed significantly to the region's industrial recovery, particularly in the extraction of coal and steel."

  # german guarantees
  holland_german_guarantees.1.d: "With tensions rising and [FRA.GetNameDef] pressuring us to relinquish control over Vlaanderen, voices in [HOL.GetNameDef] now argue that Germany must be brought in as a guarantor of our territorial integrity.\n\nIt is a gamble — one that could provoke Paris — but the prospect of German backing may be the only way to preserve our position in Flanders."

  holland_german_guarantees.2.d: "[HOL.GetNameDef] has formally approached Berlin with a request for guarantees. Citing threats to their sovereignty and unrest in the south, the Dutch government seeks German support to ward off foreign intervention.\n\nWhether this is a genuine appeal or a diplomatic maneuver remains unclear — but the decision now lies with us."

  holland_german_guarantees.3.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to extend security guarantees to [HOL.GetNameDef], a move likely intended to deter French ambitions in Vlaanderen.\n\nThis shift adds a new layer of complexity to the regional balance of power, and it signals that Germany intends to assert itself more forcefully in Western European affairs."

  holland_german_guarantees.4.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has declined the Dutch request for security guarantees. Without Berlin’s backing, [HOL.GetNameDef] now faces mounting pressure from [FRA.GetNameDef] alone.\n\nThe rejection is a significant diplomatic blow — one that may force the Netherlands to reconsider its position in Vlaanderen."

  # shell
  holland_shell.1.d: "Representatives of Royal Dutch Shell have approached the Persian government with a demand for exclusive drilling rights in the oil-rich southern territories. Backed by [HOL.GetNameDef], the company presents this as a mutually beneficial offer — promising investment and infrastructure in exchange for control over extraction operations.\n\nYet the ultimatum carries an unmistakable edge: refusal may provoke more than just economic consequences."

  holland_shell.2.d: "The Persian government has agreed to grant Royal Dutch Shell access to its southern oil fields. Dutch engineers and financiers are already en route, and the first rigs are expected to begin drilling within weeks.\n\nThis deal marks a significant expansion of [HOL.GetNameDef]’s global energy influence, while simultaneously drawing Persia deeper into Europe’s sphere of economic power plays."

  holland_shell.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has rejected Dutch demands for oil concessions. The refusal has angered both Shell executives and government officials in [HOL.GetNameDef], who now view the matter as a threat to national economic interests.\n\nTensions are rising, and military options are reportedly being considered in The Hague."

  # soesterberg
  holland_soesterberg.1.d: "A new airbase has officially opened in Soesterberg, signaling the Netherlands’ growing commitment to military aviation.\n\nPainted biplanes now line the field, and curious onlookers gather as pilots test their machines. Some whisper it's for defense — others, deterrence."
