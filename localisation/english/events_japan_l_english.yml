 japan_events.7.d:0 "Japan has presented the Qing government with a stark demand.

 japan_events.11.d:0 "The Qing government has formally accepted Japan’s offer of 'advisors,' effectively making the empire a dominion under Japanese influence.

 japan_events.12.d:0 "The Qing government has firmly rejected Japan’s proposal for an advisory role in its administration, affirming its commitment to national sovereignty.\n\nWhile this decision preserves Qing independence, it has also provoked anger in Tokyo, which may seek to impose its will through more forceful means."
