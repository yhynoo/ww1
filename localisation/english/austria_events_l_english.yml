  # assassination
  austria_assassination.1.d: "A military train bound for the southern frontier has been derailed near the Hungarian border. Sabotage is suspected — explosives were allegedly found at the site.\n\nThe incident has shaken public confidence and ignited debate in the imperial court. Was this a tragic accident, or something more sinister?"

  austria_assassination.2.d: "Austro-Hungarian investigators have captured several operatives tied to the Okhrana — the Russian secret police. Documents and coded messages seized suggest direct Russian involvement in the train sabotage.\n\nVienna is outraged. The generals demand retribution; the diplomats scramble for answers."

  austria_assassination.3.d: "An assassination attempt targeted Archduke Franz Ferdinand during a military inspection in Sarajevo. The attacker was shot at the scene and had ties to a pan-Slavic group long suspected of Russian support.\n\nThe Archduke’s fate is yet unclear. The empire reels — once again, Sarajevo becomes the flashpoint of a continental crisis."

  austria_assassination.4.d: "Following days of frenzied debate and rising public outrage, [AUS.GetName] has declared war on [SOV.GetNameDef]. The justification is clear: state-sponsored subversion and an act of violence against the Imperial House.\n\nMobilization is underway. The world holds its breath."

  austria_assassination.5.d: "In the face of overwhelming pressure, the government has chosen caution over confrontation. No troops march, no declarations are made. But across Vienna, newspapers speak of disgrace. The officer corps is livid. Monarchists decry weakness.\n\nThe empire may have avoided war — but at what cost?"

  # delegation
  austria_delegation.1.d: "A delegation of Galician industrialists has arrived in Vienna, demanding a voice in imperial reform. Their platform is pragmatic: economic liberalization, reduced tariffs, and greater influence over provincial affairs.\n\nSome in the court view compromise as a necessary evil to preserve stability. Others warn that granting such demands sets a dangerous precedent."

  austria_delegation.2.d: "Behind closed doors, a tentative compromise has been reached. While no official announcement has been made, sources suggest key tax and trade reforms are under discussion — with imperial backing.\n\nMarkets have responded with cautious optimism. But hardliners within the government remain deeply uneasy."

  austria_delegation.3.d: "The delegation’s demands have been rejected. In response, several prominent industrial leaders from Galicia have issued an open letter condemning the imperial government and hinting at coordinated economic resistance.\n\nThough dismissed by some as mere bluster, others warn that the empire cannot afford an industrial rebellion on its eastern flank."

  austria_delegation.4.d: "The imperial government has unveiled a package of economic incentives aimed at appeasing Galician industry: targeted tax breaks, investment guarantees, and expanded local autonomy in commercial matters.\n\nCritics decry it as favoritism. Supporters call it necessary pragmatism."

  austria_delegation.5.d: "Violence has erupted in Lemberg. A group of armed men — allegedly hired by disgruntled industrial interests — assaulted an imperial official during a routine inspection.\n\nWhile arrests have been made, the message is clear: dissent in the provinces is no longer confined to negotiation."

  # eastern threats
  austria_eastern_threats.1.d: "In a statement that has raised eyebrows across Europe, [AUS.GetName] has declared its support for Polish sovereignty and independence.\n\nWhile Vienna insists the move reflects a commitment to regional stability, critics point out the irony: vast Polish territories remain under imperial administration. For many Poles, the gesture rings hollow — a diplomatic maneuver cloaked in paternalism."

  austria_eastern_threats.2.d: "[AUS.GetName] has issued a formal declaration backing Ukrainian independence, citing historical ties and mutual interest in resisting eastern subversion.\n\nSkeptics in Kyiv and abroad note that the Habsburgs continue to rule over swathes of Ukrainian land. To some, this is solidarity. To others, it is the empire dressing occupation in the language of liberation."

  # italy
  austria_italy.1.d: "Some in the Austrian government consider a bold move — offering Tirol to Italy in exchange for an alliance. Desperation and hard choices define these days of war.\n\nIf Italy accepts, the balance may shift. But the price could haunt Austria long after the war is done."

  austria_italy.2.d: "Austria’s unexpected proposal arrives in Rome, promising Tirol if Italy will stand beside them in their war against France. The offer is tempting, a chance to claim our territories.\n\nYet many wonder — is Austria’s word worth trusting? Or is this just a trick born of weakness?"

  austria_italy.3.d: "Italy claims Tirol, and their banners rise over the mountains once more. With the deal sealed, their armies now march to war alongside Austria.\n\nThe alliance changes the map — but for how long will it last?"

  austria_italy.4.d: "Italy rejects Austria’s desperate offer, unwilling to be drawn into another’s struggle. In Rome, leaders speak of prudence, but some whisper of cowardice.\n\nThe war grinds on, and Austria finds itself more alone than ever."

  # vienna
  austria_vienna.1.d: "In a fiery address from the Hofburg Palace, imperial officials declared Austria’s sacred duty to defend Christianity in the East. Without naming names, the Ottomans were cast as aggressors and persecutors — a threat not just to faith, but to civilization itself.\n\nChurch bells rang across Vienna. Diplomats groaned. The specter of crusade, it seems, is not yet buried."

  austria_vienna.2.d: "An armed uprising has erupted in southern Italy. Local authorities blame separatists and malcontents, but reports suggest the rebels are unusually well-coordinated — and well-armed.\n\nRumors swirl of imperial agents and old French sympathizers fanning the flames. Vienna, of course, denies involvement. Rome is not convinced."
