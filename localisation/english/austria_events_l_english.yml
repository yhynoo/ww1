  # austria - delegation
  austria_delegation.1.d: "A delegation of Galician industrialists has arrived in Vienna, demanding a voice in imperial reform. Their platform is pragmatic: economic liberalization, reduced tariffs, and greater influence over provincial affairs.\n\nSome in the court view compromise as a necessary evil to preserve stability. Others warn that granting such demands sets a dangerous precedent."

  austria_delegation.2.d: "Behind closed doors, a tentative compromise has been reached. While no official announcement has been made, sources suggest key tax and trade reforms are under discussion — with imperial backing.\n\nMarkets have responded with cautious optimism. But hardliners within the government remain deeply uneasy."

  austria_delegation.3.d: "The delegation’s demands have been rejected. In response, several prominent industrial leaders from Galicia have issued an open letter condemning the imperial government and hinting at coordinated economic resistance.\n\nThough dismissed by some as mere bluster, others warn that the empire cannot afford an industrial rebellion on its eastern flank."

  austria_delegation.4.d: "The imperial government has unveiled a package of economic incentives aimed at appeasing Galician industry: targeted tax breaks, investment guarantees, and expanded local autonomy in commercial matters.\n\nCritics decry it as favoritism. Supporters call it necessary pragmatism."

  austria_delegation.5.d: "Violence has erupted in Lemberg. A group of armed men — allegedly hired by disgruntled industrial interests — assaulted an imperial official during a routine inspection.\n\nWhile arrests have been made, the message is clear: dissent in the provinces is no longer confined to negotiation."

  # austria - eastern threats
  austria_eastern_threats.1.d: "In a statement that has raised eyebrows across Europe, [AUS.GetName] has declared its support for Polish sovereignty and independence.\n\nWhile Vienna insists the move reflects a commitment to regional stability, critics point out the irony: vast Polish territories remain under imperial administration. For many Poles, the gesture rings hollow — a diplomatic maneuver cloaked in paternalism."

  austria_eastern_threats.2.d: "[AUS.GetName] has issued a formal declaration backing Ukrainian independence, citing historical ties and mutual interest in resisting eastern subversion.\n\nSkeptics in Kyiv and abroad note that the Habsburgs continue to rule over swathes of Ukrainian land. To some, this is solidarity. To others, it is the empire dressing occupation in the language of liberation."

  # austria - vienna
  austria_vienna.1.d: "In a fiery address from the Hofburg Palace, imperial officials declared Austria’s sacred duty to defend Christianity in the East. Without naming names, the Ottomans were cast as aggressors and persecutors — a threat not just to faith, but to civilization itself.\n\nChurch bells rang across Vienna. Diplomats groaned. The specter of crusade, it seems, is not yet buried."

  austria_vienna.2.d: "An armed uprising has erupted in southern Italy. Local authorities blame separatists and malcontents, but reports suggest the rebels are unusually well-coordinated — and well-armed.\n\nRumors swirl of imperial agents and old French sympathizers fanning the flames. Vienna, of course, denies involvement. Rome is not convinced."
