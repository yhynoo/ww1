  austria_assassination.1.d: "A military train bound for the southern frontier has been derailed near the Hungarian border. Sabotage is suspected — explosives were allegedly found at the site.\n\nThe incident has shaken public confidence and ignited debate in the imperial court. Was this a tragic accident, or something more sinister?"

  austria_assassination.2.d: "Austro-Hungarian investigators have captured several operatives tied to the Okhrana — the Russian secret police. Documents and coded messages seized suggest direct Russian involvement in the train sabotage.\n\nVienna is outraged. The generals demand retribution; the diplomats scramble for answers."

  austria_assassination.3.d: "An assassination attempt targeted Archduke Franz Ferdinand during a military inspection in Sarajevo. The attacker was shot at the scene and had ties to a pan-Slavic group long suspected of Russian support.\n\nThe Archduke’s fate is yet unclear. The empire reels — once again, Sarajevo becomes the flashpoint of a continental crisis."

  austria_assassination.4.d: "Following days of frenzied debate and rising public outrage, [AUS.GetName] has declared war on [SOV.GetNameDef]. The justification is clear: state-sponsored subversion and an act of violence against the Imperial House.\n\nMobilization is underway. The world holds its breath."

  austria_assassination.5.d: "In the face of overwhelming pressure, the government has chosen caution over confrontation. No troops march, no declarations are made. But across Vienna, newspapers speak of disgrace. The officer corps is livid. Monarchists decry weakness.\n\nThe empire may have avoided war — but at what cost?"

  # eastern threats
  austria_eastern_threats.1.d: "In a statement that has raised eyebrows across Europe, [AUS.GetName] has declared its support for Polish sovereignty and independence.\n\nWhile Vienna insists the move reflects a commitment to regional stability, critics point out the irony: vast Polish territories remain under imperial administration. For many Poles, the gesture rings hollow — a diplomatic maneuver cloaked in paternalism."

  austria_eastern_threats.2.d: "[AUS.GetName] has issued a formal declaration backing Ukrainian independence, citing historical ties and mutual interest in resisting eastern subversion.\n\nSkeptics in Kyiv and abroad note that the Habsburgs continue to rule over swathes of Ukrainian land. To some, this is solidarity. To others, it is the empire dressing occupation in the language of liberation."

  # vienna
  austria_vienna.1.d: "In a fiery address from the Hofburg Palace, imperial officials declared Austria’s sacred duty to defend Christianity in the East. Without naming names, the Ottomans were cast as aggressors and persecutors — a threat not just to faith, but to civilization itself.\n\nChurch bells rang across Vienna. Diplomats groaned. The specter of crusade, it seems, is not yet buried."

  austria_vienna.2.d: "An armed uprising has erupted in southern Italy. Local authorities blame separatists and malcontents, but reports suggest the rebels are unusually well-coordinated — and well-armed.\n\nRumors swirl of imperial agents and old French sympathizers fanning the flames. Vienna, of course, denies involvement. Rome is not convinced."
