  # assassination
  austria_assassination.1.d: "A military train bound for the southern frontier has been derailed near the Hungarian border. Sabotage is suspected — explosives were allegedly found at the site.\n\nThe incident has shaken public confidence and ignited debate in the imperial court. Was this a tragic accident, or something more sinister?"

  austria_assassination.2.d: "Austro-Hungarian investigators have captured several operatives tied to the Okhrana — the Russian secret police. Documents and coded messages seized suggest direct Russian involvement in the train sabotage.\n\nVienna is outraged. The generals demand retribution; the diplomats scramble for answers."

  austria_assassination.3.d: "An assassination attempt targeted Archduke Franz Ferdinand during a military inspection in Sarajevo. The attacker was shot at the scene and had ties to a pan-Slavic group long suspected of Russian support.\n\nThe Archduke’s fate is yet unclear. The empire reels — once again, Sarajevo becomes the flashpoint of a continental crisis."

  austria_assassination.4.d: "Following days of frenzied debate and rising public outrage, [AUS.GetName] has declared war on [SOV.GetNameDef]. The justification is clear: state-sponsored subversion and an act of violence against the Imperial House.\n\nMobilization is underway. The world holds its breath."

  austria_assassination.5.d: "In the face of overwhelming pressure, the government has chosen caution over confrontation. No troops march, no declarations are made. But across Vienna, newspapers speak of disgrace. The officer corps is livid. Monarchists decry weakness.\n\nThe empire may have avoided war — but at what cost?"

  # ausgleich
  austria_ausgleich.1: "With internal pressures mounting and the Hungarian political elite demanding greater autonomy, the imperial government is forced to revisit the Ausgleich of 1867.\n\nNegotiations offer a fragile opportunity to stabilize the Dual Monarchy — at the cost of economic and military flexibility. Refusal, however, risks inflaming nationalist tensions and further destabilizing the empire’s eastern half."

  # eastern threats
  austria_eastern_threats.1.d: "In a statement that has raised eyebrows across Europe, [AUS.GetName] has declared its support for Polish sovereignty and independence.\n\nWhile Vienna insists the move reflects a commitment to regional stability, critics point out the irony: vast Polish territories remain under imperial administration. For many Poles, the gesture rings hollow — a diplomatic maneuver cloaked in paternalism."

  austria_eastern_threats.2.d: "[AUS.GetName] has issued a formal declaration backing Ukrainian independence, citing historical ties and mutual interest in resisting eastern subversion.\n\nSkeptics in Kyiv and abroad note that the Habsburgs continue to rule over swathes of Ukrainian land. To some, this is solidarity. To others, it is the empire dressing occupation in the language of liberation."

  # franz joseph
  austria_franz_joseph.1.d: "The long reign of Emperor Franz Joseph has come to an end. From 1848 to now, he was a living monument — a symbol of stability through revolutions, wars, and decline.\n\nAs black flags rise across the empire, the question is no longer just who will rule next, but whether the empire itself can endure."

  # mosaic
  austria_mosaic.1.d: "The Austro-Hungarian Army draws recruits from a dizzying variety of ethnic groups, each speaking different languages and holding differing loyalties. Integrating these diverse populations into a cohesive fighting force remains a persistent challenge.\n\nSome propose embracing this diversity by forming ethnically homogeneous units, while others advocate for stricter linguistic and disciplinary unification."

  austria_mosaic.2.d: "Recent attempts to integrate ethnically distinct units into the army have produced friction between officers and enlisted men. Language barriers and regional loyalties have disrupted command efficiency.\n\nWhile the recruitment numbers are improving, overall operational cohesion has suffered."

  # vienna
  austria_vienna.1.d: "In a fiery address from the Hofburg Palace, imperial officials declared Austria’s sacred duty to defend Christianity in the East. Without naming names, the Ottomans were cast as aggressors and persecutors — a threat not just to faith, but to civilization itself.\n\nChurch bells rang across Vienna. Diplomats groaned. The specter of crusade, it seems, is not yet buried."

  austria_vienna.2.d: "An armed uprising has erupted in southern Italy. Local authorities blame separatists and malcontents, but reports suggest the rebels are unusually well-coordinated — and well-armed.\n\nRumors swirl of imperial agents and old French sympathizers fanning the flames. Vienna, of course, denies involvement. Rome is not convinced."

  # volker
  austria_volker.1.d: "Emperor Franz Joseph has issued a solemn appeal to the peoples of his vast and varied empire. In his proclamation, he speaks of honor, duty, and the necessity of arms to defend the monarchy against its enemies.\n\nThough composed in lofty rhetoric, it remains uncertain how many among his subjects feel truly moved — or simply weary of war already."
