  # Civil war
  poland_uprising.1.d: "In the heart of the Eastern Front, a bold uprising has erupted as Polish rebels declare their independence from Russian rule. With banners flying and rifles raised, they have seized several cities across the Vistula basin, proclaiming the resurrection of a sovereign Polish state.\n\nThe new government calls on Poles everywhere to rally behind the cause of liberty, invoking centuries of resistance against imperial domination. Though their position is precarious and the enemy vast, their cry is clear: Poland shall be free—or perish again in another attempt."

  poland_uprising.2.d: "Across the war-ravaged plains and shattered cities of Poland, the call to arms has been answered. Former legionnaires, conscripts from the Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and German armies, and even disillusioned deserters are rallying to the cause of independence.\n\nThroughout the country, they rise to the opportunity. These men, hardened by years of total war, now turn their weapons toward a single goal: the rebirth of a sovereign Poland."

  poland_uprising.3.d: "With the uprising in full swing, the industrial backbone of Central Europe is beginning to shake. In the industrial heart of the collapsing Russian Empire, factory owners and craftsmen—some loyal, others merely pragmatic—are stepping forward.\n\nThey offer tools, resources, and manpower, hoping to secure a place in the new order. Now, the revolution must decide: do we focus on equipping fighters with weapons, or invest in rebuilding the economic base that could sustain a prolonged struggle for freedom?"

  poland_uprising.4.d: "Thousands of Poles, captured during the long and brutal years of war, now languish in foreign prison camps. Some wore German uniforms, others fought for Austria or Russia, but all share a longing for a free homeland.\n\nWith the frontlines shifting and diplomacy tenuous, there is a narrow window to petition for their release."

  # german conquest
  poland_german_conquest.1.d: "With Warsaw now under German control, Berlin must decide on the next step. One option is to establish a client monarchy — a nominally sovereign Poland under heavy German influence. Supporters argue this could stabilize the region, curry favor with local elites, and provide an eager partner in future military efforts.\n\nCritics, however, question whether such a state would be trusted by its own people — or by Germany’s rivals abroad."

  poland_german_conquest.2.d: "A new Polish state has been proclaimed, its throne restored under German guidance. The move is presented as an act of reconciliation and partnership, but few doubt where the real power lies. Polish banners fly once again — though under the shadow of Berlin.\n\nWhether this is the beginning of true national renewal or just another imperial facade remains to be seen."


  # Kresy
  poland_kresy.1.d: "The Polish government has issued a formal demand for Galicia, citing historical claims and the presence of a significant Polish population in the region. Vienna now faces a critical decision: either relinquish this territory to Poland or risk escalating tensions in Central Europe.\n\nThe fate of Galicia hangs in the balance, as Poland asserts its territorial rights."

  poland_kresy.2.d: "In a surprising move, Austria-Hungary has agreed to Poland's demands and begun transferring Galicia. While many in Vienna see this as a pragmatic decision to avoid further conflict, the concession has stirred anger among some factions who view it as a betrayal of their territorial integrity.\n\nFor Poland, this marks a significant victory, solidifying its place in Eastern Europe and reasserting its historical claims over the region."

  poland_kresy.3.d: "Austria-Hungary has refused Poland's demand for Galicia, dismissing it as unjustified and threatening to escalate the situation. Vienna insists that Galicia remains an integral part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is prepared to defend its territorial claims.\n\nIn Warsaw, this rejection is seen as a major setback, and tensions are expected to rise as the possibility of conflict looms over the region."

  # Międzymorze
  poland_intermarium.0.d: "With access to the sea already secured, our government now faces a choice about its next step. Some advocate a bold move: demanding the return of Pomerania, citing historical claims and the need for maritime strength. Others propose a more ambitious route — seeking colonial holdings overseas, with Madagascar emerging as a potential purchase target.\n\nWhat path shall we take as we define Poland’s global role?"

  poland_intermarium.1.d: "The Polish delegation has formally demanded the transfer of Eastern Pomerania, claiming it as an essential part of the reborn Polish state. Citing historical borders and the need for direct access to the sea, the demand comes with veiled threats of escalation should Germany refuse.\n\nBerlin is now faced with a grave decision: accede to Polish pressure, or stand firm and risk conflict."

  poland_intermarium.2.d: "In a surprising concession, the German government has agreed to Poland’s demands and begun transferring control of Eastern Pomerania. While Berlin insists the decision was made to preserve peace, many in Germany are outraged at what they view as a national humiliation.\n\nFor Warsaw, it is a symbolic and strategic victory — one that cements its position as a Baltic power."

  poland_intermarium.3.d: "The German government has refused the Polish demand for Eastern Pomerania. Dismissing the claim as unfounded and provocative, Berlin has declared its full intention to defend its territorial integrity.\n\nThe risk of open conflict in the region has now greatly increased, as Warsaw prepares for the consequences."

  poland_intermarium.4.d: "A Polish delegation has arrived with an unusual proposal: the purchase of the island of Madagascar in exchange for financial and industrial support. The offer is backed by the Liga Morska i Kolonialna, a maritime society seeking to secure Poland’s presence overseas.\n\nThe deal is unexpected — but not without potential benefits."

  poland_intermarium.5.d: "To the surprise of many, Poland has successfully purchased Madagascar, marking its first significant overseas colonial venture. Officials in Warsaw celebrated the acquisition as the beginning of a new era for the Polish nation.\n\nReactions abroad have been mixed, with some questioning the wisdom — and motives — behind the move."

  poland_intermarium.6.d: "The Polish offer to purchase Madagascar has been rejected. The host government dismissed the proposal, reportedly due to fears over regional backlash and concerns about Polish intentions in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn Warsaw, nationalist groups are voicing outrage, while some officials call for a reassessment of Poland’s colonial ambitions."

  poland_intermarium.7.d: "Poland has extended an invitation to [ROOT.GetName], offering an alliance within the framework of the Międzymorze. The proposal is driven by the desire to unite Central Europe against common threats and to secure Poland's position in the region.\n\nThe decision now rests with [ROOT.GetName] — will they join this ambitious coalition, or will they reject the offer?"

  poland_intermarium.8.d: "[FROM.GetName] has officially accepted Poland's offer and joined the Międzymorze alliance. This marks a significant step toward consolidating power in Central Europe, as the newly formed alliance seeks to challenge external pressures and assert its influence in the region.\n\nWith [FROM.GetName] now in the fold, the balance of power in Europe is shifting."

  poland_intermarium.9.d: "[FROM.GetName] has rejected Poland's offer to join the Międzymorze alliance, citing concerns over potential entanglements and the political implications of such an alliance. Despite Poland’s efforts to create a united front, [FROM.GetName] has chosen to remain neutral, much to the disappointment of Warsaw.\n\nThe future of Central European unity now seems uncertain."

  # The Żywiec Declaration
  poland_zywiec.1.d: "We have received a formal request from Polish authorities seeking the release of prisoners of war held within our camps. These men, many of whom served with distinction in our ranks during the Great War, are now being called upon to fight for their reborn nation.\n\nReleasing them would show support for Polish sovereignty, but could entangle us in a conflict we have no wish to join."

  poland_zywiec.2.d: "In an act of goodwill, [FROM.GetName] has agreed to release thousands of Polish prisoners of war. These veterans, drawn from all the great armies of the war, now return home as heroes.\n\nTheir battle-hardened experience and deep nationalist fervor promise to strengthen the resistance in its most desperate hour."

  poland_zywiec.3.d: "[FROM.GetName] has refused to release the Polish prisoners of war held in their camps. The reasons are political, strategic, or perhaps simply indifferent—but for the thousands still behind barbed wire, the dream of fighting for their homeland must be postponed, if not extinguished entirely."
