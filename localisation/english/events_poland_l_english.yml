  # Civil war
  poland_uprising.1.d: "In the heart of the Eastern Front, a bold uprising has erupted as Polish rebels declare their independence from Russian rule. With banners flying and rifles raised, they have seized several cities across the Vistula basin, proclaiming the resurrection of a sovereign Polish state.\n\nThe new government calls on Poles everywhere to rally behind the cause of liberty, invoking centuries of resistance against imperial domination. Though their position is precarious and the enemy vast, their cry is clear: Poland shall be free—or perish again in another attempt."

  poland_uprising.2.d: "Across the war-ravaged plains and shattered cities of Poland, the call to arms has been answered. Former legionnaires, conscripts from the Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and German armies, and even disillusioned deserters are rallying to the cause of independence.\n\nThroughout the country, they rise to the opportunity. These men, hardened by years of total war, now turn their weapons toward a single goal: the rebirth of a sovereign Poland."

  poland_uprising.11.d: "As Germany is shook by the communist uprising, an unexpected window has opened in Greater Poland. With the occupying forces stretched thin, whispers of revolt are growing louder. Leaders in the underground now look to Warsaw for a decision: should they risk everything for the chance to strike now?\n\nVictory is far from certain — but so is survival under continued occupation."

  poland_uprising.12.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, fighters have risen up across Greater Poland. Towns and cities, after more than a century of dreaded German occupation, are witnessing an open insurrection. The provisional authorities have declared the reestablishment of Polish governance in the region, urging all patriots to rally to the cause.\n\nWhether this spark ignites a fire — or is extinguished by overwhelming force — remains to be seen."

  poland_uprising.13.d: "The call to arms has not gone unanswered. All across western Poland, men and women are forming militias and joining hastily organized regiments. The uprising may have been sudden, but its roots run deep — decades of quiet defiance now erupt into open resistance.\n\nWhat Poland lacks in equipment, it may yet make up for in courage and resolve."

  # german conquest
  poland_german_conquest.1.d: "With Warsaw now under German control, Berlin must decide on the next step. One option is to establish a client monarchy — a nominally sovereign Poland under heavy German influence. Supporters argue this could stabilize the region, curry favor with local elites, and provide an eager partner in future military efforts.\n\nCritics, however, question whether such a state would be trusted by its own people — or by Germany’s rivals abroad."
  poland_german_conquest.2.d: "A new Polish state has been proclaimed, its throne restored under German guidance. The move is presented as an act of reconciliation and partnership, but few doubt where the real power lies. Polish banners fly once again — though under the shadow of Berlin.\n\nWhether this is the beginning of true national renewal or just another imperial facade remains to be seen."

  # Kresy
  poland_kresy.1.d: "The Polish government has issued a formal demand for Galicia, citing historical claims and the presence of a significant Polish population in the region. Vienna now faces a critical decision: either relinquish this territory to Poland or risk escalating tensions in Central Europe.\n\nThe fate of Galicia hangs in the balance, as Poland asserts its territorial rights."
  poland_kresy.2.d: "In a surprising move, Austria-Hungary has agreed to Poland's demands and begun transferring Galicia. While many in Vienna see this as a pragmatic decision to avoid further conflict, the concession has stirred anger among some factions who view it as a betrayal of their territorial integrity.\n\nFor Poland, this marks a significant victory, solidifying its place in Eastern Europe and reasserting its historical claims over the region."
  poland_kresy.3.d: "Austria-Hungary has refused Poland's demand for Galicia, dismissing it as unjustified and threatening to escalate the situation. Vienna insists that Galicia remains an integral part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is prepared to defend its territorial claims.\n\nIn Warsaw, this rejection is seen as a major setback, and tensions are expected to rise as the possibility of conflict looms over the region."

  # Alliances
  poland_france.1.d: "With independence freshly regained and hostile powers looming on all sides, [FROM.GetNameDef] has urgently appealed to [ROOT.GetNameDef] for a formal military alliance.\n\nArguing that a united front is essential to the stability of Europe, Polish diplomats stress shared interests in resisting revanchism and authoritarianism."
  poland_france.2.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has formally welcomed [FROM.GetNameDef] into the 'Versailles Accords', the French-led military alliance.\n\nThis development marks a turning point in Eastern European security, signaling renewed French engagement in the region — and a recognition of centuries-long French-Polish friendship."
  poland_france.3.d: "While [FROM.GetNameDef] has declined a formal alliance, it has offered a bilateral guarantee of independence.\n\nThis gesture, while more limited in scope, still signals a willingness to deter aggression and uphold European peace."
  poland_france.4.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [FROM.GetNameDef] have signed a mutual defense agreement, ensuring reciprocal aid in the event of invasion.\n\nThough short of a full alliance, this pact strengthens deterrence in the volatile Eastern European theatre."
  poland_france.5.d: "Efforts to secure an agreement between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef] have failed.\n\nThough both sides may have shared interests, strategic disagreements or political hesitation have prevented deeper cooperation."
  poland_france.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has declined the offer of alliance from [ROOT.GetNameDef]. Left to face its challenges alone, Polish officials must now look elsewhere for support in a dangerous neighborhood."

  poland_ukraine.1.d: "Seeking to revive the vision of a united front stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea, [FROM.GetNameDef] has approached [ROOT.GetNameDef] with a proposal for a regional alliance — Międzymorze.\n\nCiting mutual threats and shared interests, Polish leaders argue that only a unified bloc of independent nations can secure lasting peace and sovereignty in Eastern Europe."
  poland_ukraine.2.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has accepted the proposal from [FROM.GetNameDef], and the Międzymorze Alliance has officially come into being.\n\nThis historic pact symbolizes a bold new path for Eastern Europe — one independent of the great powers of East and West."
  poland_ukraine.3.d: "Though [FROM.GetNameDef] has declined a formal alliance, it has proposed a pact of mutual defense guarantees.\n\nWhile short of a full Międzymorze union, this agreement nonetheless marks a step toward deeper regional security cooperation."
  poland_ukraine.4.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [FROM.GetNameDef] have pledged to defend one another in the face of aggression.\n\nThough not bound by a full alliance, this agreement strengthens bonds and affirms mutual resolve against external threats."
  poland_ukraine.5.d: "Discussions between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef] have ended without agreement.\n\nDespite hopes for a new regional order, political divisions or mistrust have delayed — or perhaps doomed — the Międzymorze dream."
  poland_ukraine.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has declined the offer of alliance from [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nWith Międzymorze stillborn, Polish diplomats must reconsider how best to safeguard their nation's future."

  poland_usa.1.d: "Seeking to secure its fragile independence and align itself with the values of liberty and self-determination, [FROM.GetNameDef] has formally requested to join the Anti-Colonialist Union led by [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nDrawing inspiration from Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, Polish diplomats argue that only a global democratic alliance can guarantee peace and freedom against imperialist aggression."
  poland_usa.2.d: "In a major diplomatic milestone, [ROOT.GetNameDef] has accepted [FROM.GetNameDef]'s request for alliance, welcoming them into the Anti-Colonialist Union.\n\nThis partnership represents a powerful endorsement of democratic principles in Eastern Europe, and a warning to would-be aggressors."
  poland_usa.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has declined a formal alliance for now, instead offering a pact of mutual defense.\n\nWhile short of full integration into the Anti-Colonialist Union, this agreement lays the groundwork for stronger cooperation between democratic states."
  poland_usa.4.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [FROM.GetNameDef] have pledged to guarantee each other’s independence, signaling a shared commitment to resisting aggression.\n\nThe move is seen as a meaningful gesture toward international democratic solidarity."
  poland_usa.5.d: "Despite high hopes, talks between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef] have failed to produce an agreement.\n\nSome observers blame ideological caution or strategic differences for the breakdown."
  poland_usa.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has rejected Polish overtures for alliance. With no formal ties to the Anti-Colonialist Union, [ROOT.GetNameDef] may now be forced to navigate the treacherous European geopolitical landscape alone."

  # Międzymorze
  poland_intermarium.0.d: "With access to the sea already secured, our government now faces a choice about its next step. Some advocate a bold move: demanding the return of Pomerania, citing historical claims and the need for maritime strength. Others propose a more ambitious route — seeking colonial holdings overseas, with Madagascar emerging as a potential purchase target.\n\nWhat path shall we take as we define Poland’s global role?"
  poland_intermarium.1.d: "The Polish delegation has formally demanded the transfer of Eastern Pomerania, claiming it as an essential part of the reborn Polish state. Citing historical borders and the need for direct access to the sea, the demand comes with veiled threats of escalation should Germany refuse.\n\nBerlin is now faced with a grave decision: accede to Polish pressure, or stand firm and risk conflict."
  poland_intermarium.2.d: "In a surprising concession, the German government has agreed to Poland’s demands and begun transferring control of Eastern Pomerania. While Berlin insists the decision was made to preserve peace, many in Germany are outraged at what they view as a national humiliation.\n\nFor Warsaw, it is a symbolic and strategic victory — one that cements its position as a Baltic power."
  poland_intermarium.3.d: "The German government has refused the Polish demand for Eastern Pomerania. Dismissing the claim as unfounded and provocative, Berlin has declared its full intention to defend its territorial integrity.\n\nThe risk of open conflict in the region has now greatly increased, as Warsaw prepares for the consequences."
  poland_intermarium.4.d: "A Polish delegation has arrived with an unusual proposal: the purchase of the island of Madagascar in exchange for financial and industrial support. The offer is backed by the Liga Morska i Kolonialna, a maritime society seeking to secure Poland’s presence overseas.\n\nThe deal is unexpected — but not without potential benefits."
  poland_intermarium.5.d: "To the surprise of many, Poland has successfully purchased Madagascar, marking its first significant overseas colonial venture. Officials in Warsaw celebrated the acquisition as the beginning of a new era for the Polish nation.\n\nReactions abroad have been mixed, with some questioning the wisdom — and motives — behind the move."
  poland_intermarium.6.d: "The Polish offer to purchase Madagascar has been rejected. The host government dismissed the proposal, reportedly due to fears over regional backlash and concerns about Polish intentions in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn Warsaw, nationalist groups are voicing outrage, while some officials call for a reassessment of Poland’s colonial ambitions."
  
  # The Żywiec Declaration
  poland_zywiec.1.d: "We have received a formal request from Polish authorities seeking the release of prisoners of war held within our camps. These men, many of whom served with distinction in our ranks during the Great War, are now being called upon to fight for their reborn nation.\n\nReleasing them would show support for Polish sovereignty, but could entangle us in a conflict we have no wish to join."

  poland_zywiec.2.d: "In an act of goodwill, [FROM.GetName] has agreed to release thousands of Polish prisoners of war. These veterans, drawn from all the great armies of the war, now return home as heroes.\n\nTheir battle-hardened experience and deep nationalist fervor promise to strengthen the resistance in its most desperate hour."

  poland_zywiec.3.d: "[FROM.GetName] has refused to release the Polish prisoners of war held in their camps. The reasons are political, strategic, or perhaps simply indifferent—but for the thousands still behind barbed wire, the dream of fighting for their homeland must be postponed, if not extinguished entirely."
