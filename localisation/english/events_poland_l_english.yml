  # Civil war
  poland_civil_war.1.d: "In the heart of the Eastern Front, a bold uprising has erupted as Polish rebels declare their independence from Russian rule. With banners flying and rifles raised, they have seized several cities across the Vistula basin, proclaiming the resurrection of a sovereign Polish state.\n\nThe new government calls on Poles everywhere to rally behind the cause of liberty, invoking centuries of resistance against imperial domination. Though their position is precarious and the enemy vast, their cry is clear: Poland shall be free—or perish again in another attempt."

  poland_civil_war.2.d: "Across the war-ravaged plains and shattered cities of Poland, the call to arms has been answered. Former legionnaires, conscripts from the Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and German armies, and even disillusioned deserters are rallying to the cause of independence.\n\nThroughout the country, they rise to the opportunity. These men, hardened by years of total war, now turn their weapons toward a single goal: the rebirth of a sovereign Poland."

  poland_civil_war.3.d: "With the uprising in full swing, the industrial backbone of Central Europe is beginning to shake. In the industrial heart of the collapsing Russian Empire, factory owners and craftsmen—some loyal, others merely pragmatic—are stepping forward.\n\nThey offer tools, resources, and manpower, hoping to secure a place in the new order. Now, the revolution must decide: do we focus on equipping fighters with weapons, or invest in rebuilding the economic base that could sustain a prolonged struggle for freedom?"

  poland_civil_war.4.d: "Thousands of Poles, captured during the long and brutal years of war, now languish in foreign prison camps. Some wore German uniforms, others fought for Austria or Russia, but all share a longing for a free homeland.\n\nWith the frontlines shifting and diplomacy tenuous, there is a narrow window to petition for their release."

  poland_civil_war.5.d: "We have received a formal request from Polish authorities seeking the release of prisoners of war held within our camps. These men, many of whom served with distinction in our ranks during the Great War, are now being called upon to fight for their reborn nation.\n\nReleasing them would show support for Polish sovereignty, but could entangle us in a conflict we have no wish to join."

  poland_civil_war.6.d: "In an act of goodwill—or perhaps quiet defiance of the old imperial order—[FROM.GetName] has agreed to release thousands of Polish prisoners of war. These veterans, drawn from all the great armies of the war, now return home as heroes.\n\nTheir battle-hardened experience and deep nationalist fervor promise to strengthen the resistance in its most desperate hour."

  poland_civil_war.7.d: "[FROM.GetName] has refused to release the Polish prisoners of war held in their camps. The reasons are political, strategic, or perhaps simply indifferent—but for the thousands still behind barbed wire, the dream of fighting for their homeland must be postponed, if not extinguished entirely."
