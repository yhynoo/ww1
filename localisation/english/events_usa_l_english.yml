  # War in Mexico
  usa_monroe_doctrine.1.d:0 "As Mexico continues its defense against Colombian aggression, unrest has spread within its own borders. Zapatista revolutionaries, rallying under the banner of land and liberty, have taken up arms against the central government. Their timing is no coincidence—many believe the chaos of war has provided the perfect cover for a radical transformation of Mexican society.\n\nThe civil conflict deepens, and outside powers watch closely."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.2.d:0 "The collapse of order in Mexico threatens to engulf the region in chaos. With a democratic government under siege and foreign influence spreading, Washington faces a difficult decision: support the Mexican state with material aid, or allow the nation to determine its fate alone.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine looms large in these deliberations, as does the specter of instability on America's southern border."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.3.d:0 "In a move coordinated with key business leaders, the United States has begun supporting Mexico’s war effort through private-sector arms production. Factories on American soil are being repurposed to manufacture weapons for shipment southward, offering a lifeline to the embattled Mexican government.\n\nWhile technically non-interventionist, this approach has clear implications for U.S. influence in the conflict."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.4.d:0 "As the United States formally enters the war against Colombia, concerns have risen over potential reprisals or spillover violence along the southern border. In response, the federal government has authorized the mobilization of National Guard units from Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.\n\nThough largely symbolic, this move underscores Washington's resolve to protect its homeland and enforce stability in the region."

  # Guarantees in the South
  usa_monroe_doctrine.5.d:0 "In a sweeping declaration, the United States has reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding democratic nations throughout the Western Hemisphere. This new round of guarantees is a clear signal to external powers: interference in American affairs will not be tolerated.\n\nReactions across Latin America are mixed—some welcome the shield, others fear a return to heavy-handed interventionism."
 
  # Greenland + Iceland
  usa_monroe_doctrine.6.d:0 "With Europe engulfed in crisis, the United States has moved to secure strategic outposts in the North Atlantic. Washington has declared interests in Greenland and Iceland, citing their critical position for hemispheric defense.\n\nThough framed as precautionary, these claims have raised concerns in foreign capitals about America's long-term ambitions."

  # Entente
  usa_entente.1.d:0 "The United States has extended a formal invitation to deepen military cooperation through an alliance. With global tensions escalating, Washington argues that unity among democratic powers is essential to ensuring stability and confronting common threats.\n\nThis could mark a new chapter in transatlantic relations."
  usa_entente.2.d:0 "The United States has officially joined the Entente. Analysts around the world are calling it a historic realignment that could shift the balance of power.\n\nAmerican resources and manpower are expected to greatly bolster the alliance’s efforts in the ongoing global conflict."
  usa_entente.3.d:0 "Despite diplomatic outreach from Washington, the Entente leadership has declined the offer of alliance. This decision has sparked concern among American strategists who fear that disunity may embolden rival powers.\n\nWhether this refusal marks a temporary disagreement or a deeper rift remains to be seen."

  # Wilson
  usa_wilson.1.d:0 "Woodrow Wilson, American politician and thinker, has unveiled his vision for a postwar world order in a landmark address now known as the Fourteen Points. Emphasizing self-determination, open diplomacy, and collective security, the speech calls for the formation of a new international coalition — the League of Free Nations — to uphold peace and national sovereignty around the globe.\n\nThis ambitious declaration signals a dramatic shift in American foreign policy."
  usa_wilson.2.d:0 "In a bold move, the United States has declared its support for global decolonization efforts. President Wilson's administration has criticized imperial rule as incompatible with the ideals of freedom and democracy.\n\nThis stance has provoked backlash from major colonial powers, especially [ENG.GetNameDef], which views the announcement as a direct challenge to its global influence."

  # Hegemony
  usa_cultural_hegemony.1.d:0 "The United States has proposed a formal agreement to share technological and scientific advancements through a joint research initiative. This cooperative framework would allow for faster development of military and civilian technologies alike, fostering transatlantic innovation and mutual progress.\n\nWhile it clearly benefits their influence, rejecting it may come at a cost."
  usa_cultural_hegemony.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join the United States' research-sharing framework. This decision strengthens scientific cooperation and aligns [FROM.GetNameDef] more closely with American technological standards and strategic interests."
  usa_cultural_hegemony.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has declined the American offer of research collaboration. Whether out of principle or pride, this refusal might slow their technological growth in the long run, as Washington continues to build a network of innovation-minded partners."

  # Race riots
  usa_automotive_industries.1.d:0 "Following recent federal efforts to encourage racial integration within the industrial workforce, several southern states have erupted into violent protest. The unrest is being fueled by deeply entrenched segregationist sentiments, with local authorities in some regions refusing to intervene.\n\nThe administration is faced with a choice — either back down or stand firm on its progressive reforms."
  usa_automotive_industries.2.d:0 "Despite federal reassurances and attempts to restore order, unrest has only intensified. What began as isolated incidents has grown into widespread turmoil, as opposition to integration continues to escalate.\n\nThe South is on the brink of organized resistance."
  usa_automotive_industries.3.d:0 "The United States has been plunged into internal chaos as several southern states, outraged by racial integration policies, have taken up arms in open rebellion. This marks the beginning of a brutal internal conflict — one that may rival the Civil War in scale and significance.\n\nThe global community watches as America’s unity is tested once more."
