  # War in Mexico
  usa_monroe_doctrine.1.d:0 "As Mexico continues its defense against Colombian aggression, unrest has spread within its own borders. Zapatista revolutionaries, rallying under the banner of land and liberty, have taken up arms against the central government. Their timing is no coincidence—many believe the chaos of war has provided the perfect cover for a radical transformation of Mexican society.\n\nThe civil conflict deepens, and outside powers watch closely."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.2.d:0 "The collapse of order in Mexico threatens to engulf the region in chaos. With a democratic government under siege and foreign influence spreading, Washington faces a difficult decision: support the Mexican state with material aid, or allow the nation to determine its fate alone.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine looms large in these deliberations, as does the specter of instability on America's southern border."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.3.d:0 "In a move coordinated with key business leaders, the United States has begun supporting Mexico’s war effort through private-sector arms production. Factories on American soil are being repurposed to manufacture weapons for shipment southward, offering a lifeline to the embattled Mexican government.\n\nWhile technically non-interventionist, this approach has clear implications for U.S. influence in the conflict."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.4.d:0 "As the United States formally enters the war against Colombia, concerns have risen over potential reprisals or spillover violence along the southern border. In response, the federal government has authorized the mobilization of National Guard units from Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.\n\nThough largely symbolic, this move underscores Washington's resolve to protect its homeland and enforce stability in the region."

  # Guarantees in the South
  usa_monroe_doctrine.5.d:0 "In a sweeping declaration, the United States has reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding democratic nations throughout the Western Hemisphere. This new round of guarantees is a clear signal to external powers: interference in American affairs will not be tolerated.\n\nReactions across Latin America are mixed—some welcome the shield, others fear a return to heavy-handed interventionism."
 
  # Greenland + Iceland
  usa_monroe_doctrine.6.d:0 "With Europe engulfed in crisis, the United States has moved to secure strategic outposts in the North Atlantic. Washington has declared interests in Greenland and Iceland, citing their critical position for hemispheric defense.\n\nThough framed as precautionary, these claims have raised concerns in foreign capitals about America's long-term ambitions."

  # Entente
  usa_entente.1.d:0 "The United States has extended a formal invitation to deepen military cooperation through an alliance. With global tensions escalating, Washington argues that unity among democratic powers is essential to ensuring stability and confronting common threats.\n\nThis could mark a new chapter in transatlantic relations."
  usa_entente.2.d:0 "The United States has officially joined the Entente. Analysts around the world are calling it a historic realignment that could shift the balance of power.\n\nAmerican resources and manpower are expected to greatly bolster the alliance’s efforts in the ongoing global conflict."
  usa_entente.3.d:0 "Despite diplomatic outreach from Washington, the Entente leadership has declined the offer of alliance. This decision has sparked concern among American strategists who fear that disunity may embolden rival powers.\n\nWhether this refusal marks a temporary disagreement or a deeper rift remains to be seen."

  # Wilson
  usa_wilson.1.d:0 "Woodrow Wilson, American politician and thinker, has unveiled his vision for a postwar world order in a landmark address now known as the Fourteen Points. Emphasizing self-determination, open diplomacy, and collective security, the speech calls for the formation of a new international coalition — the Anti-Colonialist Union — to uphold peace and national sovereignty around the globe.\n\nThis ambitious declaration signals a dramatic shift in American foreign policy."
  usa_wilson.2.d:0 "In a bold move, the United States has declared its support for global decolonization efforts. President Wilson's administration has criticized imperial rule as incompatible with the ideals of freedom and democracy.\n\nThis stance has provoked backlash from major colonial powers, especially [ENG.GetNameDef], which views the announcement as a direct challenge to its global influence."

  # Hegemony
  usa_cultural_hegemony.1.d:0 "The United States has proposed a formal agreement to share technological and scientific advancements through a joint research initiative. This cooperative framework would allow for faster development of military and civilian technologies alike, fostering transatlantic innovation and mutual progress.\n\nWhile it clearly benefits their influence, rejecting it may come at a cost."
  usa_cultural_hegemony.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join the United States' research-sharing framework. This decision strengthens scientific cooperation and aligns [FROM.GetNameDef] more closely with American technological standards and strategic interests."
  usa_cultural_hegemony.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has declined the American offer of research collaboration. Whether out of principle or pride, this refusal might slow their technological growth in the long run, as Washington continues to build a network of innovation-minded partners."

 # Embers of the Past
 usa_embers_of_the_past.1.d:0 "Amid growing concerns about the persistence of racial hatred and reactionary ideologies in parts of the country, reformers have proposed a nationwide education campaign focused on civil rights and national unity. The effort would confront uncomfortable truths but promises to renew America's democratic promise.\n\nYet others warn this initiative may stir unrest in regions where resentment still simmers."
 usa_embers_of_the_past.2.d:0 "In rural Arkansas, a local pastor has openly defied the government’s education campaign, condemning it as an attack on traditional values.

 usa_embers_of_the_past.4.d:0 "Across the South, fiery crosses have begun to appear once more. The Ku Klux Klan and affiliated groups, long dormant, are rekindling their hateful rhetoric under the guise of free speech and religious liberty. For now, local authorities are turning a blind eye.\n\nThe federal government must decide whether to confront these movements head-on or avoid stoking tensions further."
 usa_embers_of_the_past.5.d:0 "Leaders from several southern states have gathered in Atlanta under the banner of religious and racial 'purity.' In fiery speeches, they call for the end of federal interference and a return to what they describe as 'divinely ordered society.'\n\nSome in Washington believe a crackdown is needed—others warn that such a move could spark open conflict."
 usa_embers_of_the_past.6.d:0 "A shocking development from the South: a coalition of states has formally declared secession, establishing a theocratic regime under the name 'United Christian States of America.'\n\nThe federal government now faces the gravest crisis since the Civil War."
 usa_embers_of_the_past.7.d:0 "Across the country, private screenings of *Birth of a Nation* are drawing large crowds. Though widely condemned by progressive voices, the film is finding an eager audience in communities still steeped in racial division.\n\nIts impact is already being felt in public discourse, with extremist rhetoric gaining ground."
 usa_embers_of_the_past.8.d:0 "News of racially motivated attacks and mob violence is erupting across several southern states.
