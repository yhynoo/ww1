  # Racial tensions
  usa_racial_tensions.1.d:0 "In the aftermath of Reconstruction and the onset of the new century, old wounds have begun to reopen. Civil rights organizations warn of increasing hostility in parts of the South, where white supremacist groups have resumed activity under a new guise.\n\nThough the federal government has thus far maintained a position of restraint, unrest is spreading. If ignored, these early embers may soon ignite something far more dangerous."
  usa_racial_tensions.2.d:0 "Evangelical movements and reactionary leaders have gained traction throughout the South, blending religious fervor with calls for a return to 'traditional values.' These gatherings, often draped in patriotic symbols, mask a deeper undercurrent of racial animus.\n\nFederal officials now face a dilemma: uphold civil liberties at all costs, or begin placing limits on groups whose speech fans the flames of division."
  usa_racial_tensions.3.d:0 "News has broken of a controversial court ruling in Atlanta. Thomas Lewis, a known white nationalist, has been acquitted of the murder of a Black dockworker despite eyewitness testimony. The verdict has drawn outrage from civil rights leaders and sparked protests across several urban centers.\n\nWhile some call for federal oversight, others argue that intervention would set a dangerous precedent — further inflaming tensions already near the breaking point."
  usa_racial_tensions.4.d:0 "Reports have emerged of nighttime gatherings deep in rural Georgia. Crosses are burning once again, and leaflets calling for 'racial purity' are being distributed in small towns across the region. Authorities have yet to act decisively.\n\nCritics accuse Washington of looking the other way, while others warn that a crackdown could only deepen the divide. Either way, the country is sliding toward a dangerous threshold."
  usa_racial_tensions.5.d:0 "Thousands have gathered in Atlanta for what organizers describe as a 'heritage rally.' In reality, the event has become a lightning rod for extremist figures—many of whom openly call for a return to segregationist policies. Clashes with counter-protesters have already been reported.\n\nAcross the country, Americans are watching with growing unease. This is no longer a regional issue—it is becoming a national reckoning."
  usa_racial_tensions.6.d:0 "Spurred by populist leaders and emboldened by recent events, a wave of authoritarian sentiment is sweeping the country. Churches, town halls, and radio broadcasts echo a single message: only strong leadership can restore order and morality.\n\nNow, a fundamental choice looms: embrace this rising tide, or resist it at all costs—whatever the consequences may be."
  usa_racial_tensions.7.d:0 "Federal agents have dismantled several extremist cells and arrested key organizers linked to recent unrest. Simultaneously, a new education initiative aimed at promoting civil harmony has begun rolling out in public schools nationwide.\n\nThough many challenges remain, early signs suggest a shift in public sentiment. The United States may yet chart a course away from the precipice."
  usa_racial_tensions.8.d:0 "The film 'Birth of a Nation' is making waves across the country, praised by some for its cinematic achievements but condemned by others for its overtly racist content. In many southern towns, screenings have become rallying points for reactionary movements.\n\nWhile critics denounce the film’s historical revisionism, its popularity reflects a darker current flowing just beneath the surface of American society."
  usa_racial_tensions.9.d:0 "White mobs have erupted in violence across the South, emboldened by recent propaganda and perceived political leniency. Black neighborhoods are being looted, burned, and terrorized while local authorities often look the other way — or quietly condone the attacks.\n\nThese so-called 'race riots' are in truth one-sided massacres, reminders of a dark past many hoped had been left behind. The federal government remains under pressure to respond decisively."
  usa_racial_tensions.10.d:0 "In the wake of repressive policies and growing authoritarianism, unrest has erupted across major urban centers. Clashes between civilians and police have turned violent, as marginalized communities push back against mounting institutional hostility.\n\nCalls for calm ring hollow in the face of batons and broken windows. The American city is once again the battleground for the nation's soul."

  # War in Mexico
  usa_monroe_doctrine.1.d:0 "As Mexico continues its defense against Colombian aggression, unrest has spread within its own borders. Zapatista revolutionaries, rallying under the banner of land and liberty, have taken up arms against the central government. Their timing is no coincidence—many believe the chaos of war has provided the perfect cover for a radical transformation of Mexican society.\n\nThe civil conflict deepens, and outside powers watch closely."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.2.d:0 "The collapse of order in Mexico threatens to engulf the region in chaos. With a democratic government under siege and foreign influence spreading, Washington faces a difficult decision: support the Mexican state with material aid, or allow the nation to determine its fate alone.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine looms large in these deliberations, as does the specter of instability on America's southern border."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.3.d:0 "In a move coordinated with key business leaders, the United States has begun supporting Mexico’s war effort through private-sector arms production. Factories on American soil are being repurposed to manufacture weapons for shipment southward, offering a lifeline to the embattled Mexican government.\n\nWhile technically non-interventionist, this approach has clear implications for U.S. influence in the conflict."
  usa_monroe_doctrine.4.d:0 "As the United States formally enters the war against Colombia, concerns have risen over potential reprisals or spillover violence along the southern border. In response, the federal government has authorized the mobilization of National Guard units from Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.\n\nThough largely symbolic, this move underscores Washington's resolve to protect its homeland and enforce stability in the region."

  # Guarantees in the South
  usa_monroe_doctrine.5.d:0 "In a sweeping declaration, the United States has reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding democratic nations throughout the Western Hemisphere. This new round of guarantees is a clear signal to external powers: interference in American affairs will not be tolerated.\n\nReactions across Latin America are mixed—some welcome the shield, others fear a return to heavy-handed interventionism."
 
  # Greenland + Iceland
  usa_monroe_doctrine.6.d:0 "With Europe engulfed in crisis, the United States has moved to secure strategic outposts in the North Atlantic. Washington has declared interests in Greenland and Iceland, citing their critical position for hemispheric defense.\n\nThough framed as precautionary, these claims have raised concerns in foreign capitals about America's long-term ambitions."

  # Entente
  usa_entente.1.d:0 "The United States has extended a formal invitation to deepen military cooperation through an alliance. With global tensions escalating, Washington argues that unity among democratic powers is essential to ensuring stability and confronting common threats.\n\nThis could mark a new chapter in transatlantic relations."
  usa_entente.2.d:0 "The United States has officially joined the Entente. Analysts around the world are calling it a historic realignment that could shift the balance of power.\n\nAmerican resources and manpower are expected to greatly bolster the alliance’s efforts in the ongoing global conflict."
  usa_entente.3.d:0 "Despite diplomatic outreach from Washington, the Entente leadership has declined the offer of alliance. This decision has sparked concern among American strategists who fear that disunity may embolden rival powers.\n\nWhether this refusal marks a temporary disagreement or a deeper rift remains to be seen."

  # Wilson
  usa_wilson.1.d:0 "Woodrow Wilson, American politician and thinker, has unveiled his vision for a postwar world order in a landmark address now known as the Fourteen Points. Emphasizing self-determination, open diplomacy, and collective security, the speech calls for the formation of a new international coalition — the League of Free Nations — to uphold peace and national sovereignty around the globe.\n\nThis ambitious declaration signals a dramatic shift in American foreign policy."
  usa_wilson.2.d:0 "In a bold move, the United States has declared its support for global decolonization efforts. President Wilson's administration has criticized imperial rule as incompatible with the ideals of freedom and democracy.\n\nThis stance has provoked backlash from major colonial powers, especially [ENG.GetNameDef], which views the announcement as a direct challenge to its global influence."

  # Hegemony
  usa_cultural_hegemony.1.d:0 "The United States has proposed a formal agreement to share technological and scientific advancements through a joint research initiative. This cooperative framework would allow for faster development of military and civilian technologies alike, fostering transatlantic innovation and mutual progress.\n\nWhile it clearly benefits their influence, rejecting it may come at a cost."
  usa_cultural_hegemony.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join the United States' research-sharing framework. This decision strengthens scientific cooperation and aligns [FROM.GetNameDef] more closely with American technological standards and strategic interests."
  usa_cultural_hegemony.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has declined the American offer of research collaboration. Whether out of principle or pride, this refusal might slow their technological growth in the long run, as Washington continues to build a network of innovation-minded partners."
