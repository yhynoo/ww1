  mexico_civil_war.1.d: "Armed uprisings have erupted all of Mexico, led by agrarianist factions demanding radical land reform and the dismantling of elite rule. Under banners bearing slogans of justice and the land, Zapatista-inspired militias have taken control of rural districts and declared open rebellion.\n\nWhat began as scattered unrest has now escalated into a full-blown civil war. The old order trembles as the call of ‘land and liberty’ echoes once more."
