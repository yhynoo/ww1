  # Spanish Hyena
  spain_the_spanish_hyena.1.d: "In a bold diplomatic maneuver, Spain has offered to assume 'custodial responsibility' over the British territory of Rhodesia. Framing the proposal as a gesture of support during Britain’s colonial overstretch, Madrid argues that it can safeguard regional stability on London’s behalf.\n\nBritish officials now face a difficult question: is this a generous offer, or opportunistic overreach?"
  spain_the_spanish_hyena.2.d: "In a quiet but symbolic transfer, British authorities have accepted Spain’s offer to take over Rhodesia. Citing a need to consolidate forces elsewhere, London has relinquished control over the southern African territory.\n\nMadrid has wasted no time — Spanish troops and administrators are already moving in. A new flag now flies over Salisbury."
  spain_the_spanish_hyena.3.d: "London has dismissed Spain’s curious offer, with one official allegedly calling it 'an unserious proposal from an unserious government.'\n\nIn Madrid, the rejection has caused little visible outrage — but observers note that Spain’s interest in southern Africa may not be so easily extinguished."

  spain_the_spanish_hyena.4.d: "Spain has extended a surprising offer — this time to France. Framing it as a temporary transfer for the sake of order, Madrid has proposed assuming custody over the volatile and far-flung French Congo.\n\nIn Paris, war-weariness and colonial uncertainty fuel a quiet but growing debate: is it time to let someone else deal with Central Africa?"
  spain_the_spanish_hyena.5.d: "In a stunning development, France has accepted Spain’s request. French authorities are withdrawing from large swaths of Central Africa, allowing Spanish forces to assume control.\n\nSpain now holds vast new territories across the Congo Basin. The international press is beginning to refer to Madrid’s opportunism as 'Hyena Diplomacy' — a term not wholly unappreciated in Spanish circles."
  spain_the_spanish_hyena.6.d: "France has firmly declined Spain’s proposal, dismissing the notion of relinquishing any part of its African empire.\n\nStill, with French authority in Africa increasingly under strain, some wonder how long Paris can realistically hold the line."

  spain_the_spanish_hyena.7.d: "Madrid has now turned its attention to German South-West Africa, suggesting that Spain take over temporary control in light of Germany’s current military commitments.\n\nWhile the offer is framed as logistical support among continental allies, Berlin must now decide whether to view Spain as a partner — or a scavenger."
  spain_the_spanish_hyena.8.d: "Germany has quietly accepted Spain’s proposal. Spanish forces are en route to take over administrative duties in South-West Africa, and German colonial authorities have begun a swift withdrawal.\n\nBerlin maintains that this is a temporary arrangement. But in Madrid, officials speak increasingly of permanence."
  spain_the_spanish_hyena.9.d: "Berlin has refused Spain’s overtures, dismissing the suggestion that it is incapable of managing its overseas territories.\n\nSome German officials now suspect Spain’s 'custodial offers' mask more ambitious designs — and warn that the Spanish hyena may soon grow teeth."

  # Alliances
  spain_france.1.d: "[SPR.GetNameDefCap] has extended a formal offer of military cooperation to our government. Madrid cites shared geopolitical concerns and the threat of external aggression as justification for closer ties — including, potentially, a formal alliance.\n\nWhile some in our cabinet welcome the opportunity to bolster our position, others warn of entanglements and question Spain’s reliability."
  spain_france.2.d: "An alliance between Spain and [ROOT.GetName] has been formalized. The treaty — dubbed the 'Versailles Accords' by sympathetic journalists — pledges mutual support in the face of foreign threats.\n\nThough greeted warmly by Madrid and cautiously in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], some international observers warn this could escalate tensions across the continent."
  spain_france.3.d: "[SPR.GetNameDefCap] has declined a full alliance but countered with a proposal for mutual guarantees instead. Madrid insists this still signals strong bilateral trust — and avoids the complications of entangling commitments.\n\nSome officials see this as a prudent compromise. Others call it a diplomatic dodge."
  spain_france.4.d: "A formal agreement of mutual defense has been signed between [ROOT.GetName] and Spain. While it stops short of a full alliance, both nations now guarantee each other’s sovereignty in the event of war.\n\nThe pact is being hailed in Madrid as a breakthrough, though [ROOT.Capital.GetName] remains cautious about future obligations."
  spain_france.5.d: "Talks between Spain and [ROOT.GetName] have collapsed. Despite initial optimism, the two sides failed to find common ground — with disagreements over guarantees, military obligations, and long-term strategy.\n\nDiplomats on both sides are now working to contain the fallout."
  spain_france.6.d: "[ROOT.GetName] has rejected Spain’s offer of military cooperation. The move was met with disappointment in Madrid, where officials had hoped for a more unified continental front.\n\nWhether this refusal will lead to long-term estrangement remains to be seen."

  spain_england.1.d: "[FROM.GetName] has approached us with the intention of joining the Entente. They claim their interests now align with ours and that only cooperation can ensure the security of the continent.\n\nWhile many in our cabinet support the idea, others question whether [FROM.GetName] is a reliable long-term partner."
  spain_england.2.d: "[FROM.GetName] has formally joined the Entente. The decision was greeted with cautious optimism in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] and great fanfare in [FROM.Capital.GetName].\n\nWith [FROM.GetName] now committed to the defense of our shared interests, the Entente has gained new weight on the international stage."
  spain_england.3.d: "[FROM.GetName] has declined our offer to join the Entente directly but countered with a proposal for mutual defensive guarantees. Their diplomats argue this still represents a serious commitment — without drawing either side into unnecessary wars.\n\nSome in our government consider this a wise compromise. Others remain skeptical."
  spain_england.4.d: "A pact of mutual defense has been signed between [ROOT.GetName] and [FROM.GetName]. Though not a formal alliance, both nations have pledged to guarantee one another’s sovereignty in the face of aggression.\n\nThis agreement marks a major step forward in relations between the two powers."
  spain_england.5.d: "Talks between [ROOT.GetName] and [FROM.GetName] have broken down. No agreement on either an alliance or mutual guarantees could be reached. With tensions still high, this failed negotiation may mark the end of rapprochement — at least for now."
  spain_england.6.d: "[ROOT.GetName] has rejected [FROM.GetName]’s request to join the Entente. The decision has disappointed officials in [FROM.Capital.GetName], where expectations for closer cooperation had been running high.\n\nWhether this is a temporary setback or a lasting rift remains to be seen."

  # Colombian Arms
  spain_arms_production.1.d: "The government of [SPR.GetName] has offered to invest in our military-industrial infrastructure. Spanish officials claim this is purely a matter of strengthening friendly nations' defense capabilities, though others suggest it’s an effort to expand their influence abroad.\n\nIf accepted, this offer could significantly enhance our arms production capacity."
  spain_arms_production.2.d: "[COL.GetName] has accepted our proposal to invest in their armaments industry. Our engineers and planners are already en route to assist with construction and coordination.\n\nThis effort should not only bolster their military readiness but also deepen our political influence in the region."
  spain_arms_production.3.d: "[COL.GetName] has declined our offer to assist in building their military production capabilities. Their reasons remain vague, but it is clear they wish to retain full control over their defense sector without foreign involvement."
