  # Civil war
  ukraine_civil_war.1.d: "Amidst the chaos of civil war, a new voice has risen in the contested lands of the former Russian Empire. Ukrainian nationalists have seized control of key cities in the Dnieper region and declared the rebirth of an independent Ukraine.\n\nFlying their own banners and claiming to represent the will of the Ukrainian people, the new government calls for self-determination and the end of foreign domination. Though still fragile and surrounded by enemies, the Ukrainian proclamation marks a bold assertion of national identity—one that will not go unchallenged."

  # german conquest
  ukraine_german_conquest.1.d: "With German forces now holding much of Ukraine, Berlin must decide whether to formalize the arrangement. Some argue for the establishment of a loyal Ukrainian state — a protectorate that could ease the burden of administration, supply manpower, and legitimize Germany’s presence in the region. Others remain skeptical, pointing to the complexities of national identity and long-term governance.\n\nA decision must be made: integration, or delegation."

  ukraine_german_conquest.2.d: "The [UKR.GetName] has been proclaimed with German backing. Framed as a step toward Ukrainian autonomy, the new government is in reality closely aligned with Berlin’s interests. The move is strategic — creating a nominally independent state that reinforces Germany’s grip on the region.\n\nSkeptics at home and abroad are quick to note that true independence may be little more than a flag and a title."
