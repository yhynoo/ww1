  # Makhnovshchina
  ukraine_makhnovshchina.1.d: "Discontent has been spreading throughout the Ukrainian countryside. Reports of strikes, land seizures, and peasant agitation are becoming more frequent, particularly in regions with lingering memories of the civil war.\n\nWith Ukraine still under Russian control and the government's attention focused elsewhere, the seeds of resistance may be taking root once more. Authorities warn that unless firm action is taken, a larger crisis could emerge."

  ukraine_makhnovshchina.2.d: "Sabotage has been reported in key industrial sites across Ukraine—factories gutted by fire, rail lines damaged, and officials assaulted by masked assailants. Investigators suspect the involvement of local anarchist cells from the Makhnovist movement.\n\nThe government is divided—some urge caution, fearing political fallout, while others demand swift and decisive military intervention to restore order."

  ukraine_makhnovshchina.3.d: "A network of Ukrainian dissidents has been uncovered, allegedly preparing for a wide-scale uprising. Documents seized in the raids include pamphlets, arms caches, and plans for sabotaging communication lines.\n\nThe security services report that the threat has been neutralized—at least for now."

  ukraine_makhnovshchina.4.d: "Anarchist forces have risen in rebellion across southern Ukraine, seizing control of major towns and proclaiming a free territory. Under black flags and makeshift banners, they call for land redistribution, worker self-rule, and the abolition of all state authority.\n\nRussian troops are being mobilized to crush the insurgents, but the rebellion has already caught fire in the Zaporizhzhian region—and many fear it will spread further if not extinguished quickly."

  ukraine_makhnovshchina.5.d: "The anarchist experiment in Ukraine has come to an end. After months of turmoil, the insurgent forces have been crushed, their leaders scattered or dead. Though the uprising stirred hope among some and fear among others, few can deny its dramatic impact on the region.\n\nNow, with the black flags lowered, the imperial authority prepares to take control again — with promises of order, if not unity."

  # Civil war
  ukraine_civil_war.1.d: "Amidst the chaos of civil war, a new voice has risen in the contested lands of the former Russian Empire. Ukrainian nationalists have seized control of key cities in the Dnieper region and declared the rebirth of an independent Ukraine.\n\nFlying their own banners and claiming to represent the will of the Ukrainian people, the new government calls for self-determination and the end of foreign domination. Though still fragile and surrounded by enemies, the Ukrainian proclamation marks a bold assertion of national identity—one that will not go unchallenged."

  # german conquest
  ukraine_german_conquest.1.d: "With German forces now holding much of Ukraine, Berlin must decide whether to formalize the arrangement. Some argue for the establishment of a loyal Ukrainian state — a protectorate that could ease the burden of administration, supply manpower, and legitimize Germany’s presence in the region. Others remain skeptical, pointing to the complexities of national identity and long-term governance.\n\nA decision must be made: integration, or delegation."

  ukraine_german_conquest.2.d: "The [UKR.GetName] has been proclaimed with German backing. Framed as a step toward Ukrainian autonomy, the new government is in reality closely aligned with Berlin’s interests. The move is strategic — creating a nominally independent state that reinforces Germany’s grip on the region.\n\nSkeptics at home and abroad are quick to note that true independence may be little more than a flag and a title."
