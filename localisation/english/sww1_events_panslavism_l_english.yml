 panslavism.1.d:0 "Reports from Vienna and Constantinople suggest that Russian agents are actively spreading Pan-Slavic ideas among Slavic populations in both empires. Calls for Slavic unity, independence, and alignment with Russia have grown louder, fueling nationalist agitation in already unstable regions.\n\nIn Austria-Hungary, tensions between the government and its Slavic subjects are rising, while the Ottoman Empire faces renewed unrest in the Balkans.
