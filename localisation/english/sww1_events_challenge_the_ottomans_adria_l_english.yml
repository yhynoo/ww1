The exact details of the deal remain unclear, but one thing is certain: Ottoman influence in the Balkans continues to shrink.\n\nIn Italy, nationalist fervor is on the rise, with many hailing this as a victory for the country’s ambitions. But in Constantinople, frustration grows. How long can the empire afford to keep giving ground before war becomes inevitable?"

Turkish diplomats warn that unchecked Italian expansion could destabilize the entire Mediterranean.\n\nSome nations seem receptive to Turkey’s concerns, while others remain hesitant to involve themselves in a conflict over distant lands.

Diplomatic statements condemning Rome’s expansionism have flooded in, and some nations have even pledged military assistance to Turkey.\n\nWith international backing, the Ottoman Empire may stand a real chance of turning the tide. But Italy, emboldened by its recent victories, seems unlikely to back down without a fight. The Mediterranean braces for a broader conflict."

Diplomats express “concern,” but no real aid has been promised.

The empire’s future has never been more uncertain."

The rejection has sent shockwaves through diplomatic circles, with many now fearing that war is inevitable.\n\nRome has yet to respond, but Italian officials have made it clear that they will not tolerate Turkish defiance. Will this be the final straw before open conflict erupts in the Mediterranean?"
