With South Africa currently without an effective national government, local militias, veterans, and former political factions are beginning to assert power.\n\nThough still disorganized, these stirrings raise fears of potential uprisings or armed movements in the near future."

  south_africa_events.2.d:0 "An armed anti-socialist uprising has broken out in the Transvaal! Former Boer officers and conservative militias have declared a rejection of British socialist policies, seizing territory and forming a provisional government. Shots have already been exchanged with loyalist forces.\n\nBritish authorities warn that this may mark the beginning of a new and dangerous war in the region—what some are already calling the Third Boer War."
