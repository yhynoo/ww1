  turkey_armenia.2.d: "The Sublime Porte has publicly acknowledged 'missteps' in handling the unrest in Armenia and Assyria.

  turkey_egypt.2.d: "[FROM.GetName] has accepted the transfer of Egypt from [TUR.GetName], marking a significant territorial gain and a dramatic step in Turkey’s attempt to manage its debts.\n\nThis acquisition strengthens [FROM.GetName]'s position in the region, while Turkey faces the challenge of rebuilding its economy without one of its key provinces."
