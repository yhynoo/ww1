 dual_alliance.1.d:0 "Vienna has approached Berlin with a proposal to formally solidify the alliance between our two empires. While Germany and [AUS.GetName] have long been strategic partners, this agreement would bind the two nations even closer, ensuring military and diplomatic cooperation in any future conflict.\n\nMany in Berlin see this as a natural step, reinforcing Central European unity. However, some voices warn that tying Germany too closely to [AUS.GetName]’s internal struggles and territorial disputes could drag the Reich into unnecessary conflicts. The decision now rests with us."

 dual_alliance.2.d:0 "A new treaty has been signed in Berlin, formally solidifying the alliance between [GER.GetName] and [AUS.GetName]. Though the two empires have long cooperated, this agreement marks a deepening of their military and diplomatic ties, further entrenching the balance of power in Central Europe.\n\nThe move has been met with concern in rival capitals, particularly in [FRA.capital.GetName] and [SOV.capital.GetName], where officials fear that a more unified German-Austrian bloc could disrupt the fragile peace in Europe. The continent watches closely, wondering what this strengthened alliance will bring."

 dual_alliance.3.d:0 "A shock in Berlin—Germany has declined [AUS.GetName]’s request to formalize the alliance. While Berlin reaffirms its friendship, it refuses to commit to deeper military obligations, leaving Vienna exposed to growing pressures from both [SOV.GetNameDef] and the Balkans.\n\nThe rejection has sent waves of uncertainty through the imperial court. With tensions rising in Europe and Austria-Hungary facing internal challenges, many wonder whether Vienna can stand alone—or if it must seek new allies elsewhere."

 dual_alliance.4.d:0 "Seeking to strengthen its military capabilities, [AUS.GetName] has invited German army instructors to train its forces. [AUS.capital.GetName] presents this as a step toward modernization, but many see it as deepening Austria’s dependence on Berlin.\n\nWhile some officers welcome German expertise, nationalist factions within the empire worry this move will erode Austria’s military identity. Is this the first step toward a truly German-led army?"
