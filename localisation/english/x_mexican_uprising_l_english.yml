  x_mexican_uprising.1.d: "Armed uprisings have erupted all of Mexico, led by agrarianist factions demanding radical land reform and the dismantling of elite rule. Under banners bearing slogans of justice and the land, Zapatista-inspired militias have taken control of rural districts and declared open rebellion.\n\nWhat began as scattered unrest has now escalated into a full-blown civil war. The old order trembles as the call of ‘land and liberty’ echoes once more."

  x_mexican_uprising.2.d: "Authorities have reported a rising number of American citizens crossing the border to join the agrarianist rebellion in Mexico. Many of these so-called ‘volunteers’ are believed to be ideological radicals, drawn to the violence under the banner of land redistribution and social upheaval.\n\nWhile their numbers remain small, the government has condemned their actions as reckless, dangerous, and contrary to American values. Some in Congress are calling for legal measures to prevent further acts of foreign insurrectionism."
