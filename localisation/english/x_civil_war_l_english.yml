  # EVENTS

  # truce
  x_civil_war.1.d: "A message arrives from [FROM.GetNameDef], offering to halt the bloodshed and divide the front lines. Whether born of desperation or strategy, it is a pause — not a peace.\n\nSome view it as a trap, others as a chance to rebuild and regroup. In the silence between gunfire, the weight of the decision is heavy."

  x_civil_war.2.d: "A truce has been signed between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef], halting the fighting — for now. No celebrations follow, only guarded stares and shuffled papers.\n\nThe front stabilizes, but no one expects it to last. This is not peace, only a sharpening of knives behind the curtain."

  x_civil_war.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused the offer of truce, declaring that there can be no compromise. Their answer is war — unrelenting and final.\n\nCommanders rally for another offensive, sensing weakness in rejection. The firestorm resumes with redoubled fury."

  # cores
  x_civil_war.4.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has sent a formal request: the lands they claim as theirs must be returned. They speak of peace, identity, and stability for local population.\n\nOur generals scoff, but some advisors urge caution. Concessions might buy peace — or simply delay war."

  x_civil_war.5.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to hand over territories we demanded. The handover is swift, silent, and far from universally accepted.\n\nTo some, it is a justified return. To others, it reeks of weakness and betrayal."

  x_civil_war.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has rejected our territorial demands, insisting the land is theirs by right. Their reply came not as a letter, but as a threat.\n\nTension turns to certainty — if we want those provinces, we will have to take them. The maps are already being redrawn in blood."

  # occupation
  x_civil_war.7.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has demanded that we withdraw from areas we currently occupy. They frame it as a matter of sovereignty and stability.\n\nLetting go might ease tensions. Holding on might invite something far worse."

  x_civil_war.8.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] agreed to our request to withdraw their troops from our claimed territories. Columns move out, watched by suspicious eyes and quiet relief.\n\nWhatever the reason, the occupation ends. But the memory of it will not soon fade."

  x_civil_war.9.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] refuses to leave the territories they still hold, declaring them vital to their interests. Diplomacy has met a wall of silence.\n\nTheir troops remain — so must our resolve. Words will no longer be enough."
