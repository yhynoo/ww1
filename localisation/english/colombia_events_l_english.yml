  # gran colombia - andes
  colombia_andes.1.d: "Envoys from Bogotá have arrived bearing an ultimatum: the northern Andean territories must be returned to Gran Colombia. They speak of historical unity, of shared struggle — and of the revolution’s promise to liberate all Latin America.\n\nBut beneath the rhetoric lies a simple truth: power is shifting. The question now is whether to resist it — or yield before the storm."

  colombia_andes.2.d: "Following tense negotiations, the northern provinces of the Andes have been ceded to Gran Colombia. The decision, met with anger in some quarters, is seen by others as a necessary concession to the region’s rising power.\n\nBogotá celebrates the bloodless triumph. In Lima and Quito, questions mount about what — or who — comes next."

  colombia_andes.3.d: "Diplomacy has failed. [PRU.GetNameDefCap] has refused Bogotá’s demands and chosen defiance over reconciliation.\n\nPresident Uribe Uribe, addressing a crowd in Cartagena, declared the revolution betrayed — and promised retribution. Once again, the highlands will burn."

  # gran colombia - panama
  colombia_panama.1.d: "In a bold diplomatic move, the Colombian government has issued a formal demand to reclaim Panama — the long-lost province severed with American complicity. Bogotá insists this is not aggression, but rectification: a revolution reclaiming its stolen lands.\n\nWashington must now decide whether to yield to rhetoric and pressure — or draw the line in the tropics."

  colombia_panama.2.d: "In a decision that stunned international observers, the United States has agreed to transfer control of Panama to Gran Colombia. The handover, described by officials as a strategic retreat, is already being hailed as a national victory in Bogotá.\n\nBut in American newspapers, the headlines tell a different story: humiliation, retreat, and the end of a hemisphere undisputed."

  colombia_panama.3.d: "The United States has flatly rejected Colombia’s demands. Officials in Washington dismissed the ultimatum as ‘revolutionary adventurism’ and reaffirmed their commitment to the Panamanian status quo.\n\nPresident Uribe Uribe has vowed not to let the insult stand. In the plazas of Bogotá, crowds chant a single word: guerra."
