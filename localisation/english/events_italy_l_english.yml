  # Mediation
  italy_influence_the_uk.1.d: "The South Tirol issue has been a longstanding point of contention between Italy and [AUS.GetName]. In an attempt to resolve the dispute peacefully, Italy has turned to the United Kingdom, requesting their mediation.\n\nThis could be the first step towards a peaceful settlement, but [AUS.GetName]’s response will determine the outcome. Will Britain step in and facilitate a compromise?"
  italy_influence_the_uk.2.d: "Following the request for British mediation, [AUS.GetName] has agreed to engage in negotiations with Italy. The question now is whether [AUS.GetName] will yield to Italy’s demand for South Tirol, or whether tensions will escalate further.\n\nThe fate of this contested region lies in the hands of the two countries and their willingness to compromise."
  italy_influence_the_uk.3d: "In a historic decision, [AUS.GetName] has agreed to Italy’s demands and ceded the South Tirol region. This marks a significant victory for Italy and a peaceful resolution to the dispute.\n\nWith Britain’s mediation, the tension in the region has been alleviated, and Italy strengthens its position in Europe."
  italy_influence_the_uk.4.d: "[AUS.GetName] has rejected British mediation and refuses to cede South Tirol to Italy. This rejection could have serious consequences, as tensions between Italy and [AUS.GetName] remain high.\n\nThe future of the region is uncertain, and the diplomatic rift between the two nations may grow wider."
  italy_influence_the_uk.5.d: "In an attempt to stabilize the situation, the United Kingdom has offered Italy a guarantee rather than directly intervening in the South Tirol dispute. While this may provide some reassurance, it is far from a resolution to the issue.\n\nItaly must now decide if this offer is enough to maintain peace, or if further action is needed."
  italy_influence_the_uk.6.d: "The United Kingdom has decided not to intervene in the South Tirol dispute, leaving Italy to resolve the issue on its own. This decision has left Italy frustrated, as they had hoped for more active support.\n\nItaly must now reassess its options and consider how to move forward in the face of British inaction."
  
  # Alliances
  italy_england.1.d: "The Italian government has formally approached us with an offer to join the Entente.\n\nThough once aligned with the Triple Alliance, Italy now claims its interests are best served alongside the liberal democracies of Europe. Its grievances against Austria-Hungary — particularly over unredeemed Italian territories — have led Rome to seek common cause with [ENG.GetNameDef]."
  italy_england.2.d: "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] has been accepted into the Entente, joining [ENG.GetNameDef] in a pact of mutual defense and shared purpose.\n\nThe move marks a major shift in the European balance of power, as Italy turns away from its former allies. Enthusiasts hail this as a blow against militarism and expansionism in Central Europe."
  italy_england.3.d: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] has nat accepted us as a member of the Entente outright, but instead proposes a limited agreement of mutual guarantees.\n\nItalian officials state that while they sympathize with our cause, they are wary of becoming entangled in a broader continental conflict without clear assurances of territorial gains or national security."
  italy_england.4.d: "A mutual defense pact has been signed between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef].\n\nThough short of full alliance, this agreement binds our nations to defend each other’s sovereignty. It is seen as a sign that Italy may yet be drawn closer to the Entente’s cause."
  italy_england.5.d: "Despite our diplomatic efforts, talks with [FROM.GetNameDef] have collapsed.\n\nItalian envoys cited diverging strategic priorities and offered no alternative path forward. The failure is a disappointment to those hoping for a broader European coalition against the militarist threats."
  italy_england.6.d: "[ENG.GetNameDef] has rejected our offer of alliance.\n\nThe decision, though not unexpected, leaves the Entente without Italy’s support at a critical moment in European affairs."

  italy_france.1.d: "The Italian government has quietly reached out to us with an offer of support should [FRA.GetNameDef] find itself in conflict with [AUS.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile still officially neutral, Rome makes little effort to hide its grievances against the Habsburg Empire, particularly over the so-called 'unredeemed territories' in the Trentino and Dalmatian coasts. Their offer suggests a growing willingness to oppose the Habsburgs — albeit on carefully chosen terms."
  italy_france.2.d: "France and Italy have formalized a military alliance, establishing the foundation of a new faction: the Versailles Accords.\n\nThis development marks a serious blow to Austria-Hungary, as Italy openly aligns itself with the French cause. French and Italian planners are already drafting potential scenarios for joint operations in the Alps and Mediterranean."
  italy_france.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has declined a formal alliance, offering instead a pact of mutual defense.\n\nTheir leadership argues that while they are sympathetic to our goals and wary of Austrian aggression, they are not yet ready to commit fully to our war aims. Nevertheless, the agreement provides a valuable diplomatic bridge between our nations."
  italy_france.4.d: "Italy and France have agreed to a mutual defense pact, vowing to protect each other from foreign aggression.\n\nThough short of a full alliance, this arrangement reflects the strategic importance both nations place on Alpine security and shared geopolitical interests."
  italy_france.5.d: "Negotiations with [FROM.GetNameDef] have collapsed without result.\n\nItalian representatives cited domestic constraints and a lack of concrete benefits as reasons for walking away from the table. The failure has cast doubt on Italy’s reliability in a broader anti-Austrian coalition."
  italy_france.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has declined our offer of assistance.\n\nThough our intentions were sincere, they appear uninterested in military coordination at this stage. Whether due to diplomatic caution or deeper misgivings, the offer has been quietly turned down."

  italy_greece.1.d: "As war erupts between [GRE.GetNameDef] and [TUR.GetNameDef], [FROM.GetNameDef] has extended an offer of military assistance.\n\nItalian leaders cite their own territorial grievances with the Ottomans, particularly regarding the Dodecanese Islands and wider influence in the eastern Mediterranean. They frame the offer as a joint stand against Turkish tyranny — and a signal of southern European solidarity."
  italy_greece.2.d: "A new alliance has formed between [FROM.GetNameDef] and [ROOT.GetNameDef], solidifying a united front against Turkey.\n\nThe Mediterranean Assistance Treaty formalizes their cooperation and paves the way for joint military planning. With Italy's support, Greece's fight for independence gains significant momentum."
  italy_greece.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has offered a mutual defense pact instead of a full military alliance.\n\nWhile they stop short of direct intervention, Italian officials stress their desire to deter further Turkish aggression and to strengthen long-term regional cooperation."
  italy_greece.4.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] and [ROOT.GetNameDef] have signed a mutual defense pact.\n\nThough more limited than an alliance, the agreement represents growing military and political alignment between the two Mediterranean states."
  italy_greece.5.d: "Diplomatic negotiations with [FROM.GetNameDef] have failed to produce any tangible results.\n\nWhile there was initial hope for cooperation, Italy has chosen to remain on the sidelines — for now. Greek officials are disappointed but unsurprised."
  italy_greece.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has rejected our offer of assistance.\n\nDespite our shared interests and common rival in [TUR.GetNameDef], they have declined to coordinate with us at this time. The reasons remain unclear, though internal political hesitation is suspected."

  # Italy Demands Libya
  italy_expansion.1.d: "In a bold move, Italy has demanded that [TUR.GetName] cede control of Libya. With its sights set on expanding its empire in North Africa, Italy seeks to assert its dominance in the region.\n\n[TUR.GetName] must now decide whether to yield to Italy's demands or reject the request, with potential consequences for their relations."
  italy_expansion.2.d: "In a surprising turn of events, [TUR.GetName] has agreed to Italy's demand and ceded control of Libya. This victory marks the beginning of Italy’s imperial expansion in Africa, solidifying its position in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe region now falls under Italian control, further strengthening its influence in the region."
  italy_expansion.3.d: "[TUR.GetName] has rejected Italy's demand for Libya and refuses to surrender the territory. This defiance may lead to further conflict, as Italy is now faced with a decision on how to proceed.\n\nWill Italy escalate tensions or seek another diplomatic solution? The fate of Libya remains uncertain."
  
  # Italy Demands the Aegean Islands
  italy_expansion.4.d: "Italy has set its sights on the Aegean Islands, demanding that [TUR.GetName] cede control over them. With its ambitions for territorial expansion in the Mediterranean growing, Italy seeks to secure the islands, a strategic location for further naval dominance.\n\n[TUR.GetName] must now decide whether to submit or resist Italy’s demands."
  italy_expansion.5.d: "In a significant concession, [TUR.GetName] has agreed to Italy’s demand and transferred the Aegean Islands to Italian control. This expansion solidifies Italy’s influence in the Mediterranean, further securing its strategic position.\n\nAlthough locals complain, the Aegean Islands are now firmly under Italian dominance, marking a new chapter in Italy’s regional expansion."
  italy_expansion.6.d: "[TUR.GetName] has rejected Italy’s demand for the Aegean Islands, refusing to give up its control over the strategically important region. This rejection could have serious consequences, as Italy now faces the prospect of taking military action to assert its claim.\n\nDiplomatic efforts have failed, and the situation is growing more tense by the day."

  # Dalmatia
  italy_adriatic_demands.1.d: "University students from Trieste have petitioned the King to address what they see as the abandonment of Italian communities along the Adriatic coast. They speak of betrayal, irredentism, and the need for national renewal. Though small in number, their voices may reflect a deeper current in Italian society."
  italy_adriatic_demands.2.d: "A group of Italian citizens from the city of Zara has published a passionate letter, urging Rome to recognize the plight of Italians in Dalmatia. Their appeal mixes cultural pride with accusations of foreign repression. The letter is already circulating in nationalist circles."
  italy_adriatic_demands.3.d: "In a surprise move, the Italian government has formally asserted historical claims to parts of Dalmatia. While framed as a defense of Italian-speaking communities, the declaration is seen by Austria-Hungary and others as a potential prelude to territorial confrontation.\n\nThe Adriatic, once a quiet frontier, may soon become the epicenter of new conflict."
  italy_adriatic_demands.4.d: "The controversial poet and nationalist agitator Gabriele D’Annunzio has been arrested by Austro-Hungarian authorities in Spalato. Though his exact activities remain unclear, the arrest is seen as a provocative act by many Italians, especially those in the irredentist camp."
  italy_adriatic_demands.5.d: "News of D’Annunzio’s arrest has sparked spontaneous protests across northern Italy. In Venice, thousands gathered to denounce Austria-Hungary and call for decisive action. The demonstrations have grown in intensity, forcing the government to consider its next steps carefully."
  italy_adriatic_demands.6.d: "Tensions between Italy and Austria have escalated sharply following a series of nationalist provocations and public unrest. The Italian government, now under pressure from both popular and political factions, has issued an ultimatum: unless demands for territorial negotiation are met, military action may follow.\n\nThe Adriatic standoff has captured the attention of Europe. Observers fear another war on the continent may not be far off."
