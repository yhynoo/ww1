  # Mediation

  italy_influence_the_uk.1.d: "The South Tirol issue has been a longstanding point of contention between Italy and [AUS.GetName]. In an attempt to resolve the dispute peacefully, Italy has turned to the United Kingdom, requesting their mediation.\n\nThis could be the first step towards a peaceful settlement, but [AUS.GetName]’s response will determine the outcome. Will Britain step in and facilitate a compromise?"
  
  italy_influence_the_uk.2.d: "Following the request for British mediation, [AUS.GetName] has agreed to engage in negotiations with Italy. The question now is whether [AUS.GetName] will yield to Italy’s demand for South Tirol, or whether tensions will escalate further.\n\nThe fate of this contested region lies in the hands of the two countries and their willingness to compromise."
  
  italy_influence_the_uk.3d: "In a historic decision, [AUS.GetName] has agreed to Italy’s demands and ceded the South Tirol region. This marks a significant victory for Italy and a peaceful resolution to the dispute.\n\nWith Britain’s mediation, the tension in the region has been alleviated, and Italy strengthens its position in Europe."
  
  italy_influence_the_uk.4.d: "[AUS.GetName] has rejected British mediation and refuses to cede South Tirol to Italy. This rejection could have serious consequences, as tensions between Italy and [AUS.GetName] remain high.\n\nThe future of the region is uncertain, and the diplomatic rift between the two nations may grow wider."
  
  italy_influence_the_uk.5.d: "In an attempt to stabilize the situation, the United Kingdom has offered Italy a guarantee rather than directly intervening in the South Tirol dispute. While this may provide some reassurance, it is far from a resolution to the issue.\n\nItaly must now decide if this offer is enough to maintain peace, or if further action is needed."
  
  italy_influence_the_uk.6.d: "The United Kingdom has decided not to intervene in the South Tirol dispute, leaving Italy to resolve the issue on its own. This decision has left Italy frustrated, as they had hoped for more active support.\n\nItaly must now reassess its options and consider how to move forward in the face of British inaction."
  
  # Ask to join the Entente
  italy_influence_the_uk.7.d: "With tensions rising in Europe, Italy has proposed a formal alliance with the United Kingdom.

  italy_influence_the_uk.8.d: "Italy and the United Kingdom have officially formed an alliance, signaling a new chapter in European geopolitics. With this partnership, both nations are now stronger and more secure against potential threats.\n\nThe alliance will reshape the diplomatic landscape, and it remains to be seen how their cooperation will unfold."
  
  italy_influence_the_uk.9.d: "The United Kingdom has rejected Italy’s offer of an alliance, leaving Italy to stand alone in its efforts. The rejection is a blow to Italy, and the diplomatic rift between the two nations may deepen as a result.\n\nItaly will now need to reconsider its strategy moving forward without the support of Britain."
