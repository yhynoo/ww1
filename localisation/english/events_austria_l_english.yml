  # Contain Russian Expansion

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.1.d: "Austria-Hungary has extended an offer of alliance to Afghanistan, hoping to strengthen ties in Central Asia.\n\nThis move is seen as a counter to Russian influence in the region. Afghanistan may gain a powerful ally in its struggle against the Russians, but will they accept the offer?"

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.2.d: "Austria-Hungary has raised some eyebrows offering an alliance to Afghanistan, which was today accepted. The offer marks the beginning of a new diplomatic relationship in Central Asia.\n\nWith both countries now aligned, Austria gains a strategic partner to counter Russian expansion, while Afghanistan strengthens its position in the region."

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.3.d: "Afghanistan has rejected Austria-Hungary’s alliance offer, opting to remain neutral in the face of growing regional tensions.\n\nThis decision may strain ties with Vienna, but Afghanistan prefers to keep its independence from foreign entanglements."

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.4.d: "Austria-Hungary has openly declared its support for Polish independence, a bold move in the face of Russian control over much of Poland.\n\nAustria positions itself as a moral champion of Polish freedom, but some worry this could provoke Russia and complicate the empire’s eastern policies."

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.5.d: "Austria-Hungary has expressed support for Ukrainian independence, backing the cause of the Ukrainian people against Russian domination.\n\nThis declaration may extend Austria's influence over the region, but it risks angering Russia, which may see this as a direct challenge to its authority in Eastern Europe."

  # Second Vienna Treaty

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.1.d: "Austria-Hungary has taken a strong stance against the Ottoman Empire, pledging to liberate Orthodox Christians in Ottoman-controlled territories.\n\nThis declaration could lead to a war, but it is seen as a moral duty to defend the oppressed Christians. Will this ambitious promise be the spark for further conflict in the Balkans?"

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.2.d: "The insurgency in Southern Italy has begun, with reports of widespread unrest and calls for independence.\n\nThe situation appears to be escalating, and some suspect the involvement of Austrian agents in stirring unrest. The possibility of a new Habsburg-controlled Italian state may be within reach, but it would certainly ignite a fierce conflict with Italy."

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.3.d: "Austria-Hungary has offered France an alliance as part of a broader effort to strengthen the balance of power in Europe.\n\nThe offer holds potential, but some question whether France will accept, given its history with Austria and other European powers. Should we expect a more secure future or a diplomatic snub?"

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.4.d: "France has accepted Austria-Hungary's alliance offer, solidifying a new strategic partnership in Europe.\n\nWith the balance of power shifting, the Habsburgs and the French are now bound by a mutual defense pact. What new opportunities and challenges lie ahead with France on Austria's side?"

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.5.d: "France has rejected Austria-Hungary's offer of an alliance, citing lingering doubts about the Habsburgs' long-term stability.\n\nThis rejection may signal a missed opportunity for closer ties with a major European power, and Austria-Hungary may now have to reconsider its diplomatic approach moving forward."

  # Austro-Slavism

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.6.d: "Austria-Hungary has decided to establish the Kingdom of Croatia, further expanding the empire’s influence in the Balkans.\n\nWhile this decision may bring stability to the region, it risks inflaming tensions with Hungary, which fears the growing power of the Slavs within the empire. Will this move secure the loyalty of the South Slavic people, or will it lead to further unrest?"

  # Review the Ausgleich Agreement

  austria_review_ausgleich_agreement.1.d: "Austria-Hungary is grappling with the Magyarization of its territories, particularly in Hungary. The question now is whether to prioritize Hungary's development or seek to foster equal development across all regions of the empire.\n\nHungarian leaders demand more autonomy, but some fear that giving in to these demands could weaken the empire as a whole. Should we appease the Hungarians or work toward a more balanced approach for all territories?"
