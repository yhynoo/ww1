  # Contain Russian Expansion
  austria_contain_russian_expansion.4.d: "Austria-Hungary has made a bold diplomatic move by publicly supporting Polish independence. Vienna’s officials claim to champion the right of nations to self-determination, casting themselves as defenders of liberty against Russian domination.\n\nOf course, Austria continues to hold substantial Polish lands — including Galicia — and has shown no intention of relinquishing them. Some suspect this newfound enthusiasm for independence is less about principle and more about strategic positioning."
  austria_contain_russian_expansion.5.d: "With Polish territory secured, we now have an opportunity to establish a Kingdom of Poland under Habsburg protection. Doing so would strengthen our position in the region and offer a powerful ally against Russia — though it may also entangle us in new conflicts.\n\nShould we take this step?"
  austria_contain_russian_expansion.6.d: "The Kingdom of Poland has been officially proclaimed, with a Habsburg monarch on its throne. Austrian and Polish banners fly together as the new state aligns with Vienna against the Eastern threat.\n\nA centuries-old dream has returned — but what future awaits this revived kingdom?"
  austria_contain_russian_expansion.7.d: "The Austrian government has issued a dramatic declaration of support for Ukrainian independence, condemning Russian interference in the region and portraying itself as a patron of national sovereignty.\n\nYet critics note the irony: Austria still controls vast Ukrainian territories in Galicia and Bukovina, and there is little sign it intends to grant those regions autonomy, let alone freedom. Many now wonder whether Vienna’s support is genuine — or merely a cynical bid to weaken its rival to the East."
  austria_contain_russian_expansion.8.d: "Following the successful assertion of control in Ukraine, our government now has the chance to formally establish a new Hetmanate — a Ukrainian client state loyal to Vienna.\n\nShould we restore this historical entity as part of our strategy to counter Russian expansion?"
  austria_contain_russian_expansion.9.d: "The Hetmanate of Ukraine has been reestablished under Austrian guidance, with a Cossack leadership structure and Habsburg recognition. This new state promises to resist Russian domination and defend regional autonomy.\n\nAcross the steppes, Cossack riders once more fly the standard of freedom."

  # Alliances
  austria_afghanistan.1.d: "Envoys from [AUS.GetNameDef] have arrived in Kabul with a formal proposal: a military alliance.\n\nFraming it as a shared opportunity to contain Russian ambitions, Vienna suggests that closer cooperation would benefit both Central Europe and the mountainous frontier of South Asia."
  austria_afghanistan.2.d: "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] and [AFG.GetNameDef] have agreed to a formal alliance. Though geographically distant, both nations appear united in their desire to curb the influence of [SOV.GetNameDef].\n\nThis unexpected partnership has raised eyebrows across Europe and Central Asia, and has provoked concern in St. Petersburg."
  austria_afghanistan.3.d: "While declining a full alliance, [AFG.GetNameDef] proposes an alternative: a mutual guarantee of sovereignty.\n\nSuch an agreement would ensure diplomatic backing and defensive cooperation in the event of aggression, without the deeper obligations of a military pact."
  austria_afghanistan.4.d: "[AFG.GetNameDefCap] and [AUS.GetNameDef] have signed a mutual defense agreement. Though short of a full alliance, the deal promises mutual support in the event of unprovoked aggression.\n\nKabul is now more diplomatically aligned with Vienna than at any point in its history."
  austria_afghanistan.5.d: "Talks with [AFG.GetNameDef] have collapsed. Afghan leaders voiced concerns about being drawn into distant European wars, while Vienna expressed frustration over Kabul’s reluctance to commit to collective defense against Russian expansion."
  austria_afghanistan.6.d: "[AFG.GetNameDefCap] has rejected the alliance offer from [AUS.GetNameDef].\n\nDespite a shared distrust of [SOV.GetNameDef], the Afghan government appears unwilling to enter binding military commitments with a far-off European power."

  austria_france.1.d: "A delegation from [AUS.GetNameDef] has arrived in Paris bearing an extraordinary proposal: a formal military alliance between two of Europe's great Catholic monarchies.\n\nWith France having restored her king, Vienna sees an opportunity to revive a sacred partnership rooted in shared faith, tradition, and dynastic legitimacy — a bulwark against godless revolutionaries and secular republicanism."
  austria_france.2.d: "Austria-Hungary and monarchist France have entered into a formal military alliance. Described in Vienna as the 'Second Vienna Treaty,' the agreement revives the legacy of pre-revolutionary cooperation between Catholic powers.\n\nConservative circles hail it as a triumph of order and tradition — though in other European countries, the mood is decidedly colder."
  austria_france.3.d: "Though reluctant to fully bind itself militarily, [FRA.GetNameDef] has proposed an alternative: a mutual guarantee of sovereignty and stability.\n\nSuch an arrangement honors the shared dynastic and spiritual values of both nations without the burdens of a permanent alliance."
  austria_france.4.d: "A mutual defense pact has been signed between [FRA.GetNameDef] and [AUS.GetNameDef]. While not a full alliance, the agreement marks a new era of monarchist solidarity.\n\nThe agreement has been hailed in clerical and royalist circles as a 'safeguard for Christian Europe.'"
  austria_france.5.d: "Negotiations have faltered between [AUS.GetNameDef] and monarchist France.\n\nDespite their shared values, lingering distrust and diverging strategic interests proved too great. Some in Paris warn against overcommitting to an empire so entangled in Balkan affairs; others in Vienna suspect French royalism still bears scars from past republican upheaval."
  austria_france.6.d: "[FRA.GetNameDefCap] has declined Austria-Hungary’s offer of alliance.\n\nThough both nations now stand under royal banners, Paris has signaled that it is not yet prepared to entangle itself in Vienna’s geopolitical ambitions."

  austria_germany.1.d: "Vienna has approached Berlin with a proposal to formalize a military alliance.\n\nFraming it as a continuation of the cooperative spirit that once defined the German Confederation, Austria-Hungary appeals to shared dynastic ties and a common interest in preserving the existing order in Central Europe."
  austria_germany.2.d: "Austria-Hungary and [GER.GetNameDef] have entered into a formal alliance, embracing the spirit of cooperation that had once united Central Europe under conservative leadership.\n\nThe agreement is widely seen as a bulwark against growing pressure from the outside and within the empires, and a signal that the old order remains resilient."
  austria_germany.3.d: "Germany has declined a full military alliance but has proposed a more limited pact: mutual guarantees of sovereignty.\n\nSuch an agreement would deter aggression from rival powers without entangling either country in broader military obligations."
  austria_germany.4.d: "Germany and Austria-Hungary have signed a mutual defense agreement.\n\nThough not a full alliance, the pact strengthens ties between the two leading monarchies of Central Europe, and sends a clear signal to rivals in both East and West."
  austria_germany.5.d: "Negotiations between Austria-Hungary and Germany have failed. Despite shared cultural roots and dynastic traditions, Berlin proved unwilling to bind itself to Vienna’s strategic vision — citing either caution, rivalry, or disinterest in deeper entanglement."
  austria_germany.6.d: "Germany has formally rejected Austria-Hungary’s offer of alliance.\n\nThough the two monarchies maintain cordial relations, Berlin appears unwilling to commit to the kind of close cooperation Vienna had envisioned."

  # Second Vienna Treaty
  austria_second_vienna_treaty.1.d: "Austria-Hungary has taken a strong stance against the Ottoman Empire, pledging to liberate Orthodox Christians in Ottoman-controlled territories.\n\nThis declaration could lead to a war, but it is seen as a moral duty to defend the oppressed Christians. Will this ambitious promise be the spark for further conflict in the Balkans?"
  austria_second_vienna_treaty.2.d: "Whispers out of Vienna suggest that Austria-Hungary is quietly laying diplomatic groundwork for renewed claims on the regions of Veneto and Lombardy—territories long contested between the Habsburgs and the Italian state.\n\nThough no official statements have been made, military observers report increased activity along the border, and newspapers across Europe speculate that recent diplomatic developments may have emboldened imperial ambitions.\n\nIf Austria moves, it could reignite one of the continent’s oldest rivalries."
  austria_second_vienna_treaty.3.d: "Whispers in European diplomatic circles suggest that Austria-Hungary is quietly reviving interest in the Low Countries. While no official demands have been issued, some officials in Vienna have reportedly begun referencing the 'unfinished legacy' of the Habsburg Netherlands in private discussions.\n\nThough these murmurs may simply be nostalgic musings, they’ve stirred unease in The Hague—and curiosity in Berlin and Paris. Is this idle talk, or the first signs of Austria’s renewed ambitions in the west?"

  # Austro-Slavism
  austria_second_austro_slavism.1.d: "Austria-Hungary has decided to establish the Kingdom of Croatia, further expanding the empire’s influence in the Balkans.\n\nWhile this decision may bring stability to the region, it risks inflaming tensions with Hungary, which fears the growing power of the Slavs within the empire. Will this move secure the loyalty of the South Slavic people, or will it lead to further unrest?"

  # Review the Ausgleich Agreement
  austria_review_ausgleich_agreement.1.d: "Austria-Hungary is grappling with the Magyarization of its territories, particularly in Hungary. The question now is whether to prioritize Hungary's development or seek to foster equal development across all regions of the empire.\n\nHungarian leaders demand more autonomy, but some fear that giving in to these demands could weaken the empire as a whole. Should we appease the Hungarians or work toward a more balanced approach for all territories?"

  # Tackle Emigration
  austria_tackle_emigration.1.d: "Galicia continues to suffer population decline as thousands emigrate to America or Western Europe. The departure of skilled labor and youth has sparked concerns in Vienna about long-term economic stagnation in the eastern provinces.\n\nNew policies must be considered to encourage repatriation or at least reduce further losses."
  austria_tackle_emigration.2.d: "Following Vienna’s incentives for returning émigrés, regional officials in Lemberg have demanded increased industrial investment to sustain the newcomers.\n\nSome in the Ministry argue for targeted tax breaks, while others warn of overstretching the imperial budget."
  austria_tackle_emigration.3.d: "The Austrian government has announced new economic incentives aimed at reversing emigration trends from Galicia. Tax breaks and employment guarantees are expected to entice skilled workers to return or remain.\n\nWhile some welcome the move, critics call it an act of desperation."
  austria_tackle_emigration.4.d: "Attempts to rally émigré elites through appeals to patriotism have fallen flat. Many argue that emotional appeals are not enough without concrete economic benefits.\n\nVienna now faces pressure to back its words with resources — or reconsider its entire strategy."
  austria_tackle_emigration.5.d: "A gunfight at Krakau Station has shocked the empire. Arriving Austrian settlers clashed with local Polish and Jewish workers, resulting in several injuries.\n\nPublic trust in the colonization program has been dubious since the beginning, and now the Ministry is under pressure to take decisive action."
  austria_tackle_emigration.6.d: "Following a string of incidents and disappointing returns, the Galician colonization effort has been suspended indefinitely.\n\nCritics blame corruption and poor planning, while supporters insist the vision was never given a fair chance."
