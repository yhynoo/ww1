  # Contain Russian Expansion

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.1.d: "As tensions with Russia rise, Austria-Hungary has extended a formal offer of alliance to our nation. The proposal is framed as a defensive pact against Eastern expansionism, but some suspect Vienna hopes to reassert influence over the region through diplomacy rather than war.\n\nWill we accept?"

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.2.d: "A formal alliance has been signed between Austria-Hungary and [FROM.GetName]. Framed as a bulwark against Russian expansion, the new coalition may be the beginning of a new balance of power in Central Europe.\n\nVienna rejoices, and the eyes of Europe turn westward once more."

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.3.d: "Our offer of alliance has been declined by [FROM.GetName]. While the rejection was framed in diplomatic language, the implications are clear: Vienna must now face the Russian threat without their support — and perhaps consider alternative partnerships."

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.4.d: "Austria-Hungary has made a bold diplomatic move by publicly supporting Polish independence. Vienna’s officials claim to champion the right of nations to self-determination, casting themselves as defenders of liberty against Russian domination.\n\nOf course, Austria continues to hold substantial Polish lands — including Galicia — and has shown no intention of relinquishing them. Some suspect this newfound enthusiasm for independence is less about principle and more about strategic positioning."

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.5.d: "With Polish territory secured, we now have an opportunity to establish a Kingdom of Poland under Habsburg protection. Doing so would strengthen our position in the region and offer a powerful ally against Russia — though it may also entangle us in new conflicts.\n\nShould we take this step?"

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.6.d: "The Kingdom of Poland has been officially proclaimed, with a Habsburg monarch on its throne. Austrian and Polish banners fly together as the new state aligns with Vienna against the Eastern threat.\n\nA centuries-old dream has returned — but what future awaits this revived kingdom?"

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.7.d: "The Austrian government has issued a dramatic declaration of support for Ukrainian independence, condemning Russian interference in the region and portraying itself as a patron of national sovereignty.\n\nYet critics note the irony: Austria still controls vast Ukrainian territories in Galicia and Bukovina, and there is little sign it intends to grant those regions autonomy, let alone freedom. Many now wonder whether Vienna’s support is genuine — or merely a cynical bid to weaken its rival to the East."

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.8.d: "Following the successful assertion of control in Ukraine, our government now has the chance to formally establish a new Hetmanate — a Ukrainian client state loyal to Vienna.\n\nShould we restore this historical entity as part of our strategy to counter Russian expansion?"

  austria_contain_russian_expansion.9.d: "The Hetmanate of Ukraine has been reestablished under Austrian guidance, with a Cossack leadership structure and Habsburg recognition. This new state promises to resist Russian domination and defend regional autonomy.\n\nAcross the steppes, Cossack riders once more fly the standard of freedom."

  # Second Vienna Treaty

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.1.d: "Austria-Hungary has taken a strong stance against the Ottoman Empire, pledging to liberate Orthodox Christians in Ottoman-controlled territories.\n\nThis declaration could lead to a war, but it is seen as a moral duty to defend the oppressed Christians. Will this ambitious promise be the spark for further conflict in the Balkans?"

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.2.d: "Whispers out of Vienna suggest that Austria-Hungary is quietly laying diplomatic groundwork for renewed claims on the regions of Veneto and Lombardy—territories long contested between the Habsburgs and the Italian state.\n\nThough no official statements have been made, military observers report increased activity along the border, and newspapers across Europe speculate that recent diplomatic developments may have emboldened imperial ambitions.\n\nIf Austria moves, it could reignite one of the continent’s oldest rivalries."

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.3.d: "Austria-Hungary has offered France an alliance, inviting us to join the Second Vienna Treaty, an alliance they build as a counterbalance to the major powers in northern Europe.\n\nThe offer holds potential, but some question whether France will accept, given our history with Austria and other European powers. Should we expect a more secure future or a diplomatic snub?"

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.4.d: "France has accepted Austria-Hungary's alliance offer, solidifying a new strategic partnership in Europe.\n\nWith the balance of power shifting, the Habsburgs and the French are now bound by a mutual defense pact. What new opportunities and challenges lie ahead with France on Austria's side?"

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.5.d: "France has rejected Austria-Hungary's offer of an alliance, citing lingering doubts about the Habsburgs' long-term stability.\n\nThis rejection may signal a missed opportunity for closer ties with a major European power, and Austria-Hungary may now have to reconsider its diplomatic approach moving forward."

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.6.d: "Austria-Hungary has extended an alliance offer to Spain, proposing Madrid join the Second Vienna Treaty—a strategic bloc designed to counterbalance northern European dominance.\n\nThe proposal evokes a mix of interest and skepticism. Can Austria-Hungary and Spain truly align after centuries of divergence, or will this be another missed chapter in Bourbon-Habsburg cooperation?"

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.7.d: "Spain has agreed to join the Second Vienna Treaty, aligning itself with Austria-Hungary in a historic move. The alliance marks a rekindling of strategic cooperation between Madrid and Vienna not seen since the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nWith this pact, the balance of power in southern Europe shifts dramatically."

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.8.d: "Spain has declined Austria-Hungary’s offer to join the Second Vienna Treaty. Spanish diplomats have expressed concern over Austria’s political coherence and the viability of the alliance in the long term.\n\nThis refusal may complicate future cooperation between the two historic monarchies, and Vienna must now reassess its outreach strategy in the south."

  austria_second_vienna_treaty.9.d: "Whispers in European diplomatic circles suggest that Austria-Hungary is quietly reviving interest in the Low Countries. While no official demands have been issued, some officials in Vienna have reportedly begun referencing the 'unfinished legacy' of the Habsburg Netherlands in private discussions.\n\nThough these murmurs may simply be nostalgic musings, they’ve stirred unease in The Hague—and curiosity in Berlin and Paris. Is this idle talk, or the first signs of Austria’s renewed ambitions in the west?"

  # Austro-Slavism

  austria_second_austro_slavism.1.d: "Austria-Hungary has decided to establish the Kingdom of Croatia, further expanding the empire’s influence in the Balkans.\n\nWhile this decision may bring stability to the region, it risks inflaming tensions with Hungary, which fears the growing power of the Slavs within the empire. Will this move secure the loyalty of the South Slavic people, or will it lead to further unrest?"

  # Review the Ausgleich Agreement

  austria_review_ausgleich_agreement.1.d: "Austria-Hungary is grappling with the Magyarization of its territories, particularly in Hungary. The question now is whether to prioritize Hungary's development or seek to foster equal development across all regions of the empire.\n\nHungarian leaders demand more autonomy, but some fear that giving in to these demands could weaken the empire as a whole. Should we appease the Hungarians or work toward a more balanced approach for all territories?"
