  x_war_weariness.1.d: "The war drags on, and the faces of the young grow fewer with each passing week. Recruitment halls stand half-empty, while mothers walk past them with lowered eyes and empty arms.\n\nIn country and city alike, the absence is deafening — streets once alive with youthful laughter now echo with footsteps of the old. The people do not ask if the war can be won, but rather how many more must be lost before the price is too high."

  x_war_weariness.2.d: "Shops are shuttered, schoolyards silent, and fields untended. The lifeblood of the nation has been drained, not by enemy fire alone, but by time and despair.\n\nEven the voices of the newspapers grow tired, their headlines heavy with casualty lists. What remains of the home front now walks like mourners through a land at war with itself."
