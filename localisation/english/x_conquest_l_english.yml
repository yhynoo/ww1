  x_conquest.1.d: "For the first time in decades, foreign banners fly over Warsaw — but not the imperial Russian tricolor. The city, scarred yet unbroken, greets the arrival of new troops with cautious hope.\n\nDebate already brews in cafés and council halls: is this a liberation, or merely another chapter in the long tale of occupation?"
  x_conquest.2.d: "Kyiv has changed hands again. The golden domes shimmer in the morning sun, but the people have grown wary of flags and uniforms. What matters now is who stays — and what they build.\n\nFrom the shadows of St. Sophia to the banks of the Dnieper, whispers stir: perhaps this time, something new may begin."
  x_conquest.3.d: "Riga stands quiet, its harbor still and its streets lined with faces — some defiant, others weary. The Russian grip has been broken, but the shape of freedom remains unclear.\n\nIn old Lutheran churches and half-burned civic halls, the question echoes: what comes after the empire?"
  x_conquest.4.d: "The banners of [GER.GetNameDef] now hang over the towns and castles of Hungary, as if the age of emperors has returned in full. Imperial columns march through lands once ruled by kings and magnates, their presence a stark reminder of Europe’s shifting order.\n\nFrom the Danube’s bends to Transylvanian heights, folk murmur whether this is the dawn of new dominion or the echo of old empires reborn."
  x_conquest.5.d: "In Zagreb, the standards of [GER.GetNameDef] rise where once the crowns of Hungary and Croatia intertwined. The city’s stone streets bear witness to a new power, its soldiers invoking the ancient majesty of emperors past.\n\nTo some, the German eagle promises stability; to others, it is but another herald of foreign rule cloaked in the trappings of history."

  x_conquest_atmosphere.1.d: "Triumphant German columns now parade through the heart of Paris. The Arc de Triomphe stands tall above a tide of field grey and iron discipline.\n\nFrom the balconies, Parisians look on in disbelief — and perhaps, just a little awe. Champagne is reserved for the high command."
  x_conquest_atmosphere.2.d: "In a moment soaked in symbolism, Austrian officers oversee a Christian liturgy within Hagia Sophia. The great cathedral’s mosaics gleam once more beneath candlelight.\n\nThe theologians are already arguing about jurisdiction. The soldiers simply marvel."

  x_conquest_atmosphere.3.d: "London has fallen. With calm efficiency, our forces secured the city center, pausing only to note the curious silence of Big Ben.\n\nCommand reports no serious resistance, but several instances of unsolicited tea service. Discipline was maintained."
  x_conquest_atmosphere.4.d: "Vienna opens her gates not with fire, but with weary dignity. Our officers now stroll through the city of Strauss and Schnitzel, their boots echoing in baroque courtyards.\n\nA requisitioned piano was found tuned. It did not remain silent for long."
  x_conquest_atmosphere.5.d: "St. Petersburg lies still. The great palaces of the north gleam under grey skies as our banners rise above the Admiralty.\n\nCivilians watch with cautious eyes, unsure whether to expect liberation, occupation — or both."

  x_conquest_atmosphere.6.d: "German officers, advancing through a captured French estate, made a rather fortunate discovery in the cellar. Cases of vintage champagne, untouched and unlabeled.\n\nOfficial reports call it 'requisitioned material.' Unofficially? A toast was made. Or a few."
  x_conquest_atmosphere.7.d: "French troops in Cologne have wasted no time immersing themselves in local culture — beginning, naturally, with a spirited debate over Kölsch and Riesling. The former is cold and crisp; the latter, dignified and French-approved.\n\nOne officer has proposed a tasting session 'for diplomatic purposes.' The troops responded with enthusiasm."

  x_conquest_atmosphere.8.d: "With the Union Jack now flying over Hamburg, English troops have settled in comfortably. Local taverns have even begun offering fish and chips — though the authenticity is, frankly, suspicious.\n\nThe men approve. The officers pretend not to."
  x_conquest_atmosphere.9.d: "Ukrainian banners now fly above Tsaritsyn’s battered fortifications. The steppe wind carries songs of victory through the empty streets.\n\nCossack scouts have reportedly held impromptu races in the central square. Command is investigating, though not very diligently."
  x_conquest_atmosphere.10.d: "Spanish forces now patrol the sultry streets of Casablanca. The air is thick with spice and intrigue — and the officers, with sunburn.\n\nOne captain insists the city deserves a film. His comrades agree, as long as it’s not a tragedy."
