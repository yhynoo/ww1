  # algeria
  france_algeria.1.d: "Whispers of discontent echo through the rugged Algerian mountains. Reports of sabotage, protests, and clashes with colonial authorities grow by the day.\n\nWhile the unrest seems local, intelligence suggests external forces may be fanning the flames — fingers point towards Germany, eager to weaken French resolve abroad. The government must decide: a thorough investigation to root out the agitators, or hope the trouble subsides on its own before it erupts into full rebellion."

  france_algeria.2.d: "The unrest has exploded into open rebellion across Algeria. Despite attempts to contain it, the uprising spreads rapidly, fueled by both local grievances and covert support from hostile powers.\n\nThe French government faces a grim reality — this is no mere disturbance, but the beginning of a costly war for control of their prized colony."

  # antwerp affair
  france_antwerp_affair.1.d: "Facing internal chaos due to the reckless actions of General van Heutsz — the so-called Antwerp Affair — the Dutch government was pleasantly surprised by France's offer to take over Vlaanderen.\n\nThough reluctant to relinquish territory, this move aims to restore order and prevent further escalation. The crisis now hinges on France’s willingness to step up where the Netherlands has failed."

  france_antwerp_affair.2.d: "The Netherlands have accepted France's offer to take over the control of Vlaanderen. This decisive action may stabilize the region, offering hope to a population caught between competing powers.\n\nYet this concession also draws France deeper into a complex geopolitical struggle, with rival states watching anxiously for any sign of weakness."

  france_antwerp_affair.3.d: "The Dutch government has declined France’s offer to take over Vlaanderen, unwilling to fully surrender control, citing lack of trust in French ability to stabilize Belgium as a reason.\n\nThis refusal prolongs uncertainty, risking further violence and destabilization, and raises questions about whether the Netherlands has decided to make what until now was seen as rogue adventurism its official policy."

  france_antwerp_affair.4.d: "In the wake of Germany's surprise march into Belgium in late 1911, France now demands Wallonia’s return, asserting its role as protector of Belgian independence and regional stability.\n\nGermany faces a difficult decision: yield the occupied territories peacefully or risk forcing France's hand — and an outright war."

  france_antwerp_affair.5.d: "In a reluctant but strategic concession, Germany has agreed to withdraw from Wallonia, returning the province to French control and, by extension, Belgian sovereignty.\n\nThis move may prevent immediate war but does little to ease the underlying tensions between the two powers, setting the stage for future rivalry."

  france_antwerp_affair.6.d: "Germany has rejected France’s demand for Wallonia, refusing to abandon its claims despite international pressure. This hardened stance fuels fears of an escalating conflict that could engulf the region.\n\nWith diplomacy faltering, the possibility of war looms larger than ever, threatening to unravel fragile peace."

  france_antwerp_affair.7.d: "Within Germany, hawkish factions see an opportunity to strike at a politically unstable France and assert dominance in the West. Rising war support emboldens calls for decisive military action against French ambitions.\n\nHowever, cautionary voices warn that such a conflict risks dragging all of Europe into a devastating war, making restraint a crucial, if difficult, choice."

  france_antwerp_affair.8.d: "France now controls both Flanders and Wallonia, fulfilling its role as guarantor and restorer of Belgian sovereignty. This territorial consolidation marks a significant diplomatic victory.\n\nYet the broader geopolitical landscape remains volatile, with rival powers watching closely and old grievances far from settled."

  # avant-garde art controversy
  france_art.1.d: "The avant-garde art scene in Paris has come under fire from conservative critics who accuse a prominent artist of promoting anarchist ideals through his work.\n\nThe government faces a dilemma: demand explanations and risk inflaming the artistic community, or stand aside and let creative freedom flourish amidst political tension."

  france_art.2.d: "In a spirited public statement, the artist vehemently denies any anarchist sympathies, insisting his work aims only to challenge convention and inspire thought.\n\nThis defense has calmed some fears and boosted public confidence, but the debate over art’s role in politics is far from over."

  # caribbean
  france_carribean.1.d: "France has formally demanded the return of its former Caribbean colonies, citing historical claims and strategic interests. The move sends shockwaves through the region, especially in Haiti, where our sovereignty hangs in the balance.\n\nThe colonial powers now face a tense standoff: will they cede these valuable territories peacefully, or resist France’s ambitions and risk igniting a wider conflict?"

  france_carribean.2.d: "In a significant diplomatic development, the Caribbean colonies have been transferred back to French control. This marks a major victory for France’s colonial aspirations and reshapes the balance of power in the region.\n\nYet, questions remain over the future governance of these territories and how local populations will respond to renewed French rule."

  france_carribean.3.d: "[ROOT.GetName] have flatly rejected France’s demands, refusing to relinquish control over their colonies. This defiance escalates tensions and puts the region on the brink of war.\n\nAs diplomatic talks falter, the possibility of military confrontation looms, threatening to draw in global powers and unsettle an already volatile region."

  # legitimists rising
  france_legitimists.1.d: "A letter from the House of Orleans has found its way into political circles, stirring debate. Their calls for a return to traditional monarchy are dismissed by some as reckless fantasy, yet their influence is quietly growing.\n\nThe government must decide whether to outright reject these royalist musings or cautiously consider their appeal amidst France’s turbulent politics."

  france_legitimists.2.d: "The Chambers have publicly dismissed the monarchist proposals, reaffirming the Republic’s commitment to democratic rule.\n\nThough this brings short-term stability, the Legitimists' ideas continue to simmer beneath the surface, hinting at future unrest."

  france_legitimists.3.d: "In Lyon, a sizable Legitimist demonstration demands the restoration of the monarchy, rattling the government and its supporters.\n\nWill the authorities seek a peaceful compromise, or will these royalist fervors escalate into outright rebellion?"

  france_legitimists.4.d: "Rumors swirl of a ‘state within a state,’ as monarchist sympathizers gain control of key institutions. The Republic faces a critical crossroads: adapt to this shifting political landscape or risk losing its grip on power.\n\nSome see opportunity in compromise, others a threat to the nation's future."

  france_legitimists.5.d: "The Orleanist uprising has erupted, shaking France to its core. Monarchist forces rally behind the banner of the ‘holy order,’ challenging the Republic’s legitimacy.\n\nCivil war now looms large — will France be torn apart by its past, or will the Republic survive this royalist tempest?"

  # rhineland
  france_rhineland.1.d: "With Germany engulfed in civil war, France has seized the opportunity to press long-dormant claims on the Rhineland. French diplomats have issued a stern ultimatum: cede the western borderlands or face the consequences.\n\nTo some in Paris, this is the fulfillment of Versailles. To others, it's unfinished business from 1871. For Germany, it’s a moment of humiliation — or defiance."

  france_rhineland.2.d: "French forces have crossed into the Rhineland unopposed. The chaotic situation in Germany has left the region exposed, and Paris has acted quickly to secure the border and 'restore order.'\n\nThough presented as a stabilizing measure, the move is already sparking debate abroad. Is France reasserting dominance — or inflaming a powder keg?"

  france_rhineland.3.d: "[FROM.GetName] has refused France’s ultimatum. Despite their internal divisions, they have chosen to resist foreign demands rather than surrender sovereign territory.\n\nThe path of diplomacy has ended. The specter of war looms once more over the Rhine."
