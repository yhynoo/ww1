 second_vienna_treaty.3.d:0 "The fragile unity of Italy is in peril as the Habsburg-backed government in Venetia has declared independence. Claiming to reject Italian rule, Venetian leaders have aligned themselves with Austria, seeking protection from Vienna.\n\nRome has responded with outrage, declaring war to restore national unity. With Austria backing the rebels, is this the start of a larger conflict?"

 second_vienna_treaty.4.0:d "A rebellion has erupted in the Papal States as monarchist forces attempt to overthrow the Italian government. Insurgents claim to be acting in the name of the Pope, seeking to restore papal sovereignty over central Italy.\n\nWith the Italian army now battling rebels within its own borders, the future of the kingdom looks increasingly uncertain. Can Rome suppress the uprising, or will foreign powers take advantage of the chaos?"

 second_vienna_treaty.5.0:d "The Bourbon monarchy of the Two Sicilies has been reestablished with French support, undoing the unification of Italy in the south. The restored kingdom has declared itself a legitimate government, rejecting the rule of Rome.\n\nThe Italian government sees this as an existential threat—war has been declared, and once again, the fate of the peninsula will be decided on the battlefield."
