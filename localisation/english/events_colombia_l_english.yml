  # Challenge the United States
  colombia_challenge_the_us.1.d: "The government of [COL.GetName] has issued a bold demand: the immediate return of Panama. Once a province torn away under dubious circumstances to facilitate the construction of the canal, Colombia now claims historical, cultural, and sovereign rights over the region.\n\nBacked by the recently incorporated Central American republics, [COL.GetName] dares challenge the American colossus."
  colombia_challenge_the_us.2.d: "In a stunning act of de-escalation, the United States has agreed to transfer control of Panama to [COL.GetName]. \n\nWhether out of caution or shifting priorities, Washington has chosen to avoid further tensions with the growing anti-imperialist bloc in Latin America."
  colombia_challenge_the_us.3.d: "As expected, the United States has refused Colombia's demands. In response, [COL.GetName] has declared its intention to seize Panama by force, issuing a war goal as it rallies the population of Central America against perceived imperial injustice."
  colombia_challenge_the_us.4.d: "In a shocking move, [COL.GetName] has laid claim not only to Panama, but also to territories far beyond. Using old maps, revolutionary rhetoric, and fierce opposition to U.S. hegemony, Colombia has declared itself the rightful voice of Latin America and now asserts claims over parts of the American West.\n\nTensions rise as Washington watches this bold new player on the world stage."

  # Alliances
  colombia_france.1.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with an offer of military assistance. They are proposing an alliance that would see our nations closely cooperate in matters of defense and strategy.\n\nAccepting their offer would ensure support in times of conflict, though it may also entangle us in foreign disputes."
  colombia_france.2.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [FROM.GetName] have formalized a military alliance. The agreement marks a significant development in international diplomacy, strengthening the Versailles Accords and signaling a unified stance against external threats."
  colombia_france.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has declined full alliance, but instead offered a pact of mutual guarantees. This ensures each nation's sovereignty and defense without forming a formal military bloc."
  colombia_france.4.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [FROM.GetName] have agreed to a mutual defense arrangement. Should either nation come under attack, the other will intervene in its defense. This is a strong gesture of trust and solidarity."
  colombia_france.5.d: "Negotiations between [ROOT.GetName] and [FROM.GetName] have broken down. Despite efforts to reach an understanding, no agreement could be made regarding mutual defense or alliance."
  colombia_france.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has declined our offer of military cooperation. While disappointing, this outcome underscores the complexities of international diplomacy and diverging national interests."

  colombia_spain.1.d: "In a gesture reminiscent of our shared history, [FROM.GetName] has extended an offer of military assistance. The Spanish Crown recognizes the growing monarchist sentiment within Colombia and seeks to forge a formal alliance, evoking the legacy of Hispano-American unity.\n\nSuch a pact could mark the beginning of a renewed Hispanic political and cultural bloc."
  colombia_spain.2.d: "[COL.GetNameDefCap] and [FROM.GetName] have formally joined forces under a new alliance. Echoing the days of royal concord and shared heritage, the alliance — termed the 'Hispanic Union' — represents more than strategic cooperation; it symbolizes a cultural reunion with the Old World."
  colombia_spain.3.d: "While [FROM.GetName] has declined to form a formal alliance, they offer a mutual guarantee of sovereignty and protection. It is a diplomatic gesture rooted in mutual respect and a recognition of our intertwined histories."
  colombia_spain.4.d: "A pact of mutual defense has been signed between Colombia and [FROM.GetName]. Though short of a full alliance, it stands as a commitment to one another’s security — a modern continuation of centuries-old bonds."
  colombia_spain.5.d: "Talks between Colombia and [FROM.GetName] have failed to yield any form of agreement. Despite our shared language and heritage, diplomatic goals could not be aligned at this time."
  colombia_spain.6.d: "[FROM.GetName] has declined Colombia’s offer of cooperation. Whether out of caution or divergent interests, this decision dampens hopes for a closer Hispanic alliance in the near future."

  # Pacific expansion
  colombia_pacific_expansion.1.d: "With Colombia standing at the forefront of a new Latin American resurgence, Bogotá now turns its eyes south. The regions of northern Peru — historically contested and home to peoples aligned culturally and economically with Colombia — have become a rallying point.\n\nAccusing the Peruvian liberal elites of neglect and repression, [COL.GetName] demands the immediate cession of the Northern Andes."
  colombia_pacific_expansion.2.d: "In a surprise move, Peru has chosen to yield to Colombian demands. Northern Andes provinces are now under Colombian control. Whether this decision stems from diplomatic exhaustion or strategic retreat, it marks a major victory for Colombia's expansionist ambitions."
  colombia_pacific_expansion.3.d: "Peru has flatly rejected Colombia's territorial claims. Calling the demands 'a thinly veiled land grab', the Peruvian government has refused to entertain any further negotiations.\n\nIn response, Colombia has declared its right to enforce its claims by military means."
  colombia_pacific_expansion.4.d: "[COL.GetName] has issued a stark warning to the Peruvian government. Denouncing the treatment of Andean communities and accusing Lima of perpetuating liberal elitism at the expense of the people, Colombia now threatens full-scale invasion.\n\nWar in the Pacific highlands looms once again as Latin America inches closer to wider conflict."

  # Spanish Influence
  colombia_spanish_influence.1.d: "Spanish diplomats and investors have become a regular presence in Bogotá, and whispers of deeper political alignment are beginning to stir. While many in government welcome the influx of capital and expertise from the Iberian Peninsula, others warn of creeping neocolonialism.\n\nMonarchist integrationists speak openly of a restored Hispanic unity — with a Catholic king on the throne. The government must now choose how to navigate these currents."
  colombia_spanish_influence.2.d: "Colombian government has publicly rebuffed Spain’s soft-power overtures, calling for a reaffirmation of national independence and Latin American sovereignty. [SPR.GetNameDefCap] has responded frostily, and diplomatic channels are now strained as both parties downplay the growing rift."
  colombia_spanish_influence.3.d: "Spanish envoys have been warmly received by the Ministry of Commerce. A wave of joint investment initiatives has followed, with new industrial zones under rapid construction. The move is popular among economic elites, though critics argue it places Colombia in the shadow of its former colonizer."
  colombia_spanish_influence.4.d: "A faction of monarchist intellectuals and integrationist clergy has issued a public demand: the restoration of a Catholic monarch in Colombia. They argue that the military administration has failed and call for a return to traditional order under the spiritual guidance of the Crown.\n\nThough still fringe, their calls are growing bolder."
  colombia_spanish_influence.5.d: "The Colombian government has taken decisive action to suppress the growing monarchist movement. The leading integrationist organizations have been disbanded, their press silenced, and their members placed under surveillance.\n\nSpain has expressed concern over the erosion of civil discourse in the country."

  # Integration of Mexico
  colombia_integration_of_mexico.1.d: "With the Mexican state brought to heel, Bogotá must now decide how best to govern this vast and populous land. The people are proud and fiercely independent, and any approach risks backlash.\n\nShould we attempt to rule through local intermediaries, or enforce unity through direct military authority?"
  colombia_integration_of_mexico.2.d: "A provisional Mexican government, operating under Colombian oversight, has been installed in the Palacio Nacional. While nominally autonomous, it answers directly to Bogotá.\n\nThis arrangement has calmed the more pragmatic factions, though many still see it as a betrayal of national dignity."
  colombia_integration_of_mexico.3.d: "With Colombian troops patrolling Mexican cities and strict military curfews enforced, resistance is growing. Yet, in tandem, anti-American rhetoric is being embraced across both Colombia and Mexico, uniting them in a shared cause against foreign exploitation.\n\nNew posters, sermons, and speeches stoke the flames of Latin unity."
  colombia_integration_of_mexico.4.d: "A fiery speech delivered by a priest in Oaxaca, titled the 'Sermon of Dignity', has gone viral across both nations. It condemns decades of foreign — American — meddling and calls for an unbreakable Hispanic brotherhood, under one banner, one Church, and one destiny.\n\nThe people respond with chants and marches of unification."
  colombia_integration_of_mexico.5.d: "Colombian officials report a breakthrough in the integration of Mexico. Compliance has soared as local elites join the Colombian administration, and border checkpoints now display both flags side by side.\n\nThe region stands poised to be fully incorporated into the growing union of Hispanic republics."
