  # central america
  usa_central_america.1.d: "In a bold diplomatic overture, [USA.GetName] has offered us formal alignment under their protection. Framed as a guarantee of security and stability, the offer would see us relinquish a degree of sovereignty in exchange for economic support and military backing.\n\nAmid threats from abroad and within, the choice is stark: autonomy with risk, or safety with strings attached."

  usa_central_america.2.d: "[FROM.GetName] has accepted the American proposal and entered into a formal alignment with [USA.GetName]. Though officially framed as a strategic partnership, the arrangement places [FROM.GetName] in a subordinate political role, effectively under U.S. oversight.\n\nReaction across the region is mixed — some see shelter under a giant, others see a surrender masked in diplomacy."

  usa_central_america.3.d: "[FROM.GetName] has rejected [USA.GetName]’s offer of political alignment, choosing to chart an independent course despite ongoing crises. The decision has been hailed as courageous by some and reckless by others.\n\nWith no foreign shield to rely on, the government must now face its mounting challenges alone."

  usa_central_america.4.d: "Rumors swirl in diplomatic circles that [USA.GetName] is preparing for a military intervention in Central America, where Colombian forces have consolidated power.\n\nSupporters frame the potential invasion as a mission to restore stability and protect economic interests.

  usa_iww.1.d: "With the coal market collapsing due to falling exports and reduced industrial demand, conditions in the Appalachian coalfields have worsened dramatically. In West Virginia, thousands of miners, many associated with the Industrial Workers of the World, have gone on strike.\n\nTheir demands include higher wages, union recognition, and an end to brutal company town policies. Local authorities appear unwilling — or unable — to contain the unrest."

  usa_iww.3.d: "Federal marshals deployed to West Virginia clashed violently with armed miners outside Blair Mountain. Casualty estimates are unclear, but several deaths are confirmed.\n\nThough the government insists the operation was defensive, critics warn this is a dangerous escalation. Some fear that the strike is transforming into an outright rebellion, fueled by radical labor organizers and growing public discontent."

  usa_iww.4.d: "In [USA.GetNameDef], the conflict in the coalfields has spilled over into a broader insurrection. Rail lines in Illinois have been sabotaged, strikes are spreading across Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and reports from Colorado indicate open fighting. The IWW has declared a “Workers' Resistance” and is calling for nationwide solidarity.\n\nForeign observers are beginning to describe the situation as a low-intensity civil war."

  usa_iww.5.d: "Testimonies before a special congressional committee have revealed shocking abuses by coal companies, including blacklisting, forced evictions, and the use of private militias. Public outrage is mounting, and several lawmakers have now broken with industrial backers, calling for sweeping anti-monopoly legislation.\n\nThe strike may not be over, but the political tide has clearly turned."

  # mexico
