  # central america
  usa_central_america.1.d: "In a bold diplomatic overture, [USA.GetName] has offered us formal alignment under their protection. Framed as a guarantee of security and stability, the offer would see us relinquish a degree of sovereignty in exchange for economic support and military backing.\n\nAmid threats from abroad and within, the choice is stark: autonomy with risk, or safety with strings attached."

  usa_central_america.2.d: "[FROM.GetName] has accepted the American proposal and entered into a formal alignment with [USA.GetName]. Though officially framed as a strategic partnership, the arrangement places [FROM.GetName] in a subordinate political role, effectively under U.S. oversight.\n\nReaction across the region is mixed — some see shelter under a giant, others see a surrender masked in diplomacy."

  usa_central_america.3.d: "[FROM.GetName] has rejected [USA.GetName]’s offer of political alignment, choosing to chart an independent course despite ongoing crises. The decision has been hailed as courageous by some and reckless by others.\n\nWith no foreign shield to rely on, the government must now face its mounting challenges alone."

  usa_central_america.4.d: "Rumors swirl in diplomatic circles that [USA.GetName] is preparing for a military intervention in Central America, where Colombian forces have consolidated power.\n\nSupporters frame the potential invasion as a mission to restore stability and protect economic interests. Detractors call it imperialism by another name."

  # embers of the past
  usa_embers_of_the_past.1.d: "Wilson Walker, a black man from Savannah, has been arrested and charged with the murder of a local white man. The case has quickly inflamed racial tensions across the South and ignited fierce debates nationwide. Some see this as a blatant miscarriage of justice, others as a sign of societal decay.\n\nThe nation watches closely as pressure mounts to either intervene or let the courts take their course."

  usa_embers_of_the_past.2.d: "After a contentious trial filled with heated testimony and allegations of bias, Wilson Walker has been acquitted. The verdict sent shockwaves through many communities, praised by civil rights advocates but decried by others as a failure of the legal system.\n\nThe decision threatens to deepen the divide between progressive and conservative factions in the country."

  usa_embers_of_the_past.3.d: "A powerful sermon delivered in Savannah by a prominent Christian preacher has galvanized fundamentalist groups, calling for action to uphold 'traditional values' and 'law and order.' The sermon condemns the verdict as an attack on morality and social stability.\n\nThis fiery rhetoric threatens to inflame existing tensions and prompt a response from the authorities."

  usa_embers_of_the_past.4.d: "Following the sermon, law enforcement has arrested several individuals connected to white supremacist groups accused of plotting violence. These arrests are seen by some as necessary to restore order, but others view them as government overreach against ‘patriotic defenders’ of the old way.\n\nThe nation remains divided on how best to handle this volatile situation."

  usa_embers_of_the_past.5.d: "In response to rising unrest, an Atlanta convention of fundamentalists and nationalist groups has convened, condemning the government’s actions and asserting their right to protect ‘American heritage.’ The gathering has been marked by calls for stronger isolationist policies and a return to ‘Christian values.’\n\nThe event has deeply polarized the country and cast a shadow over national unity."

  # mexican uprising
  usa_mexican_uprising.1.d: "In a dramatic shift from its traditionally reserved foreign policy, [USA.GetName] has announced a sweeping aid package to support the embattled democratic government of Mexico. With the nation under threat from both internal insurgents and a Colombian military incursion, this assistance may prove decisive.\n\nWhile some hail the move as a stand for liberty in the Americas, critics warn it could mark the first crack in the country’s long-held isolationist stance."

  usa_mexican_uprising.2.d: "Reports from the southern border confirm that U.S. forces have conducted limited cross-border raids targeting known agrarianist strongholds. The operation, coordinated with friendly local authorities, resulted in the capture of weapons caches and the disruption of rebel supply lines.\n\nWhile officials maintain the incursion was both necessary and lawful, critics have already begun questioning the long-term implications of deeper involvement in the conflict."

  usa_mexican_uprising.3.d: "A planned U.S. raid against suspected agrarianist camps in northern Mexico has ended in failure. Troops encountered unexpected resistance and were forced to withdraw with casualties and no confirmed objectives achieved.\n\nOpponents of intervention are seizing on the operation’s failure as proof of poor planning and misplaced priorities. The administration has offered no official comment."
