  spain_africa.1.d: "Spain has put forward a formal demand for Morocco, seeking to expand its influence and secure a foothold in western Africa. This move comes amid growing competition among colonial powers in Africa.\n\nThe pressure is now on us to decide whether to concede to Spain’s claim or risk conflict over these contested territories."

  spain_africa.2.d: "In a significant concession, [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to transfer control of the key Moroccan territories, including Casablanca, to Spain. This diplomatic victory bolsters Spain’s position in North Africa and strengthens its colonial empire.\n\nHowever, the transfer will undoubtedly deepen tensions with rival powers eyeing influence in the region."

  spain_africa.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has firmly rejected Spain’s demands for Casablanca and the surrounding regions. The refusal marks a hardening of stances that may escalate into open hostilities if neither side is willing to back down.\n\nSpain must now consider whether to pursue diplomatic pressure or prepare for a potential military confrontation."
  
  #cuba
  spain_cuba.1.d: "More than a decade after Spain lost Cuba in the war of 1898, Madrid has issued a formal demand for the island’s return. Officials describe the current arrangement as a relic of foreign interference and unfinished business.\n\nThe United States now faces a stark choice: resist old grievances — or risk igniting them again."

  spain_cuba.2.d: "Citing shifting priorities and limited public interest, the United States has agreed to transfer sovereignty over Cuba back to Spain. The move has stunned much of the world, with some hailing it as a step toward reconciliation, and others as a retreat from America’s hard-won influence.\n\nSpanish banners now fly once again over Havana."

  spain_cuba.3.d: "Washington has refused Madrid’s demand for Cuba, calling it a ‘revisionist fantasy’ and a threat to regional stability. The decision closes the door on any diplomatic resolution.\n\nIn Spain, voices in the press and parliament grow louder: the humiliation of 1898 must be answered."
