  spain_africa.1.d: "Spain has put forward a formal demand for Morocco, seeking to expand its influence and secure a foothold in western Africa. This move comes amid growing competition among colonial powers in Africa.\n\nThe pressure is now on us to decide whether to concede to Spain’s claim or risk conflict over these contested territories."

  spain_africa.2.d: "In a significant concession, [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to transfer control of the key Moroccan territories, including Casablanca, to Spain. This diplomatic victory bolsters Spain’s position in North Africa and strengthens its colonial empire.\n\nHowever, the transfer will undoubtedly deepen tensions with rival powers eyeing influence in the region."

  spain_africa.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has firmly rejected Spain’s demands for Casablanca and the surrounding regions. The refusal marks a hardening of stances that may escalate into open hostilities if neither side is willing to back down.\n\nSpain must now consider whether to pursue diplomatic pressure or prepare for a potential military confrontation."
