 ancien_regime.0.d:0 "Bourbon monarchy has been restored in France. The tricolor has been lowered, and the white flag of the monarchy once again flies over Paris. The government proclaims a return to traditional rule, seeking to undo over a century of republicanism.\n\nThe international response is mixed—some hail the return of order, while others fear this is merely the beginning of a broader reactionary wave. With a Bourbon king once more on the throne, what comes next for France?"

 ancien_regime.1.d:0 "The court in Madrid has been presented with an extraordinary offer—France has proposed a union between the two Bourbon crowns, restoring the old dynastic connection that once bound the nations together. Advocates argue that this would strengthen Spain’s position in Europe, while critics warn of French dominance.\n\nThe decision before Spain is historic. Will the Bourbon monarchs reunite their realms, or will Spain stand independent?"

 ancien_regime.2.d:0 "A stunning announcement from Paris and Madrid—France and Spain have agreed to unite under a single Bourbon ruler, reviving the dynastic union of old. The French king is now sovereign over both nations, promising stability and strength for the Bourbon cause.\n\nAcross Europe, alarm bells ring. Will this new dual monarchy seek further expansion, or will it be content with what it has claimed? The balance of power in Europe has undoubtedly shifted."

 ancien_regime.3.d:0 "Madrid has firmly rejected the French offer of dynastic unification, declaring Spain will remain sovereign and independent. In Paris, this refusal is seen as an insult—after all, are they not family?\n\nSome voices within the French court argue that force could settle the matter. Should France accept Spain’s decision, or is this an opportunity to claim what rightfully belongs to the Bourbons?"
