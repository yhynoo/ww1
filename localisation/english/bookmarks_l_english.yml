 END_OF_AN_ERA_NAME:0 "End of an Era"
 END_OF_AN_ERA_DESC:0 "La Belle Époque is coming to the end. Europe industrialized, and other parts of the world are following in her footsteps. Old monarchies hold together, but the internal turmoils grow every day. What will all of this lead to?"

 END_OF_AN_ERA_AUS_DESC:0 "The empire stands on a knife's edge, its many peoples pulling in different directions. Reform could hold it together, but nationalism and revolution threaten to unravel centuries of rule. Whether through compromise or force, Vienna must decide its future before others do."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_FRA_DESC:0 "France hesitated, and Belgium fell. Called to protect its neighbor, the Republic moved too slowly, and now German boots march where diplomacy failed. The Netherlands grasped for Flanders, but chaos reigns. At home, monarchists and republicans clash over the nation's soul, while abroad, old alliances waver. France must decide—restore order, reclaim honor, or risk being left behind."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_GER_DESC:0 "Germany stands at a turning point, torn between tradition and ambition. Monarchists dream of stability and strength, reformers push for democracy, and its place in the world remains uncertain. Whether through diplomacy or militarism, its next move will shape history."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_ITA_DESC:0 "Italy navigates a delicate balance between monarchy and reform. The House of Savoy seeks stability, while nationalists push for territorial expansion. Diplomatically, Italy must choose between old alliances, new ententes, or Mediterranean dominance. Will it embrace tradition, modernize, or forge its own destiny?"

 END_OF_AN_ERA_RUS_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire stands at a crossroads. Monarchists seek to reinforce the Tsar's rule, while reformists push for a stronger Duma. Abroad, Russia's ambitions grow through alliances and Pan-Slavism. Will the empire stand firm, embrace reform, or face upheaval?"

 END_OF_AN_ERA_TUR_DESC:0 "Guided by the ideals of the Young Ottomans, the Empire survived the tumultous 19th century without disintegration. Victories abroad and cautious modernization at home have preserved its strength — but not resolved its contradictions. Now, the Turks stand between imperial authority and civic reform, with the fate of millions hanging in the balance."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_USA_DESC:0 "America stands at a crossroads, torn between shaping the world or turning inward. Intervention could forge alliances, fuel industry, and challenge empires, while isolationism offers stability, profit, or even radical change. Whatever path it takes, the choice will echo far beyond its borders."
