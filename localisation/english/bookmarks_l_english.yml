 END_OF_AN_ERA_NAME: "End of an Era"
 END_OF_AN_ERA_DESC: ""

 END_OF_AN_ERA_AUS_DESC: "Austria-Hungary, once the heart of European diplomacy, captured Bosnia in 1908 but struggles with a decaying economy and an outdated army.\n\nBut how long can that unity last? With the beloved emperor aging, nationalist tensions boil beneath the surface—threatening to tear the dual monarchy apart before it can face the modern world."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_COL_DESC: "Colombia has risen higher than any could have expected. Under Rafael Uribe Uribe’s rule, it rallied Central America against foreign domination and threw off the yoke of the Yankee boot.\n\nBut David has awoken Goliath. Now at war with Mexico and under the shadow of American might, Colombia faces its greatest test — whether revolution can outlast resistance."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_ENG_DESC: "The sun still never sets on the United Kingdom, but public faith is fading. The Boer War’s atrocities have stained the nation’s conscience, and the old Conservative order is losing its grip.\n\nWill London cling to tradition and colonial dominance — or embrace reform and lead the world into a new century?"

 END_OF_AN_ERA_FRA_DESC: "France bears the scars of 1871 and still reels from the humiliation of 1911, when Germany’s march into Belgium went unanswered. The republic appears fragile — caught between shame abroad and chaos at home.\n\nWithin, monarchists demand order while anarchists call for revolution. France’s enemies may not need to fire a shot if the state tears itself apart."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_GER_DESC: "Germany hungers for its “place in the sun,” but the world is already carved up. Colonial ambitions meet growing resistance, and few are willing to share the table.\n\nAt home, victory brings no bread. Discontent simmers in the factories as the monarchy marches forward — on a path many no longer trust."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_HOL_DESC: "The 1911 intervention in Flanders revealed a chilling truth: the Dutch government cannot control its own military. General Jo van Heutsz commands more than just troops — he may soon command the state itself.\n\nAs Flemish and Walloon refugees pour in and democracy wavers, the Netherlands stands at a crossroads between civilian rule and quiet authoritarianism."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_ITA_DESC: "The country is united, but only on paper. The recent failures in Libya exposed how fragile the kingdom still is, mocked even by the weak Ottomans.\n\nThe unredeemed lands — Tirol, Dalmatia — loom like a wound. And within, the deeper question remains: there is Italy, but are there Italians?"

 END_OF_AN_ERA_JAP_DESC: "The Meiji reforms lit a fire under Japan, and the triumph of 1905 confirmed it: the empire is strong, modern, unstoppable. Industrial growth and military pride push Japan toward a larger destiny.\n\nBut how far can the empire stretch before it snaps? The West watches warily — and one misstep could awaken the sleeping giants."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_MAN_DESC: "China has taken its first steps toward democracy, but the foundations are weak. The nation is sick: opium is everywhere, the economy is broken, and warlords test the limits of central control.\n\nThe Boxer Rebellion left deep scars. Foreign powers still circle like vultures — but without them, the country may not survive what comes next."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_MEX_DESC: "Mexico is young, fragile, and already bleeding. Its fledgling democracy stumbles as the war with Colombia drags on, and Washington’s hand weighs heavily on every decision.\n\nBeneath the surface, deeper dangers stir: whispers of communism, army defections, and a people unsure if their nation will survive — or collapse from within."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_RUS_DESC: "Despite the wounds of 1905, the Russian Empire marches into the new century with confidence. The tsar's grip seems firm, and industrial growth should eventually arrive in the vast interior.\n\nYet the empire’s wealth is built on others' backs. Its restless borderlands grow louder, and their patience — like their chains — will not last forever."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_SPR_DESC: "Spain is an empire no longer. Humiliated by defeat and stripped of its colonies, the old kingdom lingers on — proud, bitter, and aimless.\n\nAs monarchists falter and republicans rally, new voices demand something bolder: democracy, socialism, even revolution. If Spain cannot reclaim its place abroad, it must find a purpose at home."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_TUR_DESC: "After the tumultous 19th century, the Ottoman Empire has begun to stabilize under the Young Ottomans’ guidance. The sick man lives on, tired but not yet dead.\n\nThere is a long road ahead, but for the first time in years, there is reason to believe the empire might walk it."

 END_OF_AN_ERA_USA_DESC: "The United States has become the industrial engine of the world, driven by innovation and a belief in its exceptional destiny. Yet, at home, a deep divide grows between modern progress and rising Christian fundamentalism.\n\nShould America lead the world as a beacon of Wilsonian idealism — or retreat behind oceans and walls, untouched and unconcerned?"
