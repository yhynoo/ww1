 END_OF_AN_ERA_AUS_DESC:0 "The empire stands on a knife's edge, its many peoples pulling in different directions. Reform could hold it together, but nationalism and revolution threaten to unravel centuries of rule. Whether through compromise or force, Vienna must decide its future before others do."
 END_OF_AN_ERA_DEN_DESC:0 "Denmark stands as a northern power, yet one overshadowed by its imperial neighbors. Though united, Scandinavia remains economically and militarily fragile, its modernization slow and its influence marginal. Surrounded by giants, Denmark must find its place in a world that seldom notices it."
 END_OF_AN_ERA_FRA_DESC:0 "France hesitated, and Belgium fell. Called to protect its neighbor, the Republic moved too slowly, and now German boots march where diplomacy failed. The Netherlands grasped for Flanders, but chaos reigns. At home, monarchists and republicans clash over the nation's soul, while abroad, old alliances waver. France must decide—restore order, reclaim honor, or risk being left behind."
 END_OF_AN_ERA_GER_DESC:0 "Germany stands at a turning point, torn between tradition and ambition. Monarchists dream of stability and strength, reformers push for democracy, and its place in the world remains uncertain. Whether through diplomacy or militarism, its next move will shape history."
 END_OF_AN_ERA_HOL_DESC:0 "The Netherlands teeters on uncertainty, its army stranded in Flanders, its government paralyzed by panic. What began as a protective gesture has spiraled into a diplomatic disaster. Meanwhile, its vast colonies in Indonesia and Indochina remain a question mark—should they be defended, reformed, or abandoned?"
 END_OF_AN_ERA_ITA_DESC:0 "Italy navigates a delicate balance between monarchy and reform. The House of Savoy seeks stability, while nationalists push for territorial expansion. Diplomatically, Italy must choose between old alliances, new ententes, or Mediterranean dominance. Will it embrace tradition, modernize, or forge its own destiny?"
 END_OF_AN_ERA_RUS_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire stands at a crossroads. Monarchists seek to reinforce the Tsar's rule, while reformists push for a stronger Duma. Abroad, Russia's ambitions grow through alliances and Pan-Slavism. Will the empire stand firm, embrace reform, or face upheaval?"
 END_OF_AN_ERA_SWI_DESC:0 "Switzerland stays blissfully untouched, perched high in its mountains, counting cheese and gold while the world burns. With a perfect record of neutrality, it excels at sitting this one out—though it wouldn't mind if you'd just put a stamp on that form."
 END_OF_AN_ERA_TUR_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire teeters on the brink, caught between reform and tradition. The Young Turks push for change, while the Sultan clings to power. Nationalism and revolt threaten its unity, and the path forward—through modernity or monarchy—will decide its fate."
 END_OF_AN_ERA_USA_DESC:0 "America stands at a crossroads, torn between shaping the world or turning inward. Intervention could forge alliances, fuel industry, and challenge empires, while isolationism offers stability, profit, or even radical change. Whatever path it takes, the choice will echo far beyond its borders."
