 # intro event
 baltic_events.1.d:0 "Riga has erupted into violence as angry crowds have taken to the streets, targeting German-owned businesses and homes. The resentment stems from long-standing ethnic tensions, economic hardship, and nationalist agitation. While the Russian authorities struggle to maintain order, Berlin watches with concern as ethnic Germans in the Baltic region face increasing hostility."

 # decision chain
 baltic_events.2.d:0 "The recent violence in Riga has sparked outrage in Germany, with nationalist voices calling for intervention to protect the German community in the Baltic region.\n\nThe government now faces a crucial decision—should Germany issue an ultimatum to Russia, demand a protectorate, or stay out of the conflict altogether?"

 baltic_events.3.d: "Reports of German military movements near the Russian border suggest that Berlin is preparing to take action in the Baltic region.\n\nGermany has signaled that it will not stand by while ethnic Germans face violence, and diplomatic channels are now abuzz with speculation over how [SOV.GetNameDef] will respond."

 baltic_events.4.d: "The German government has formally demanded that [SOV.GetNameDef] recognize a German protectorate over the Baltic region, citing the need to protect ethnic Germans from further violence.\n\nThe Russian leadership must now decide whether to accept German oversight, propose an alternative solution, or refuse outright."

 baltic_events.5.d: "In a surprising turn, the Russian government has agreed to [GER.GetNameDef]’s demands and formally ceded control over the Baltic territories. German officials are already overseeing the transition, with the new Baltic protectorate coming under Berlin’s administration.\n\nWhile some see this as a pragmatic move to avoid conflict, Russian nationalists view it as a national humiliation."

 # alliance
 baltic_events.6.d: "Instead of simply handing over the Baltic region, [SOV.GetNameDef] has proposed an alternative—joint administration of the region under a Russo-German alliance.\n\nThis unprecedented offer could stabilize the area while ensuring cooperation between Berlin and St. Petersburg, but it remains to be seen whether the Germans will accept this compromise."

 baltic_events.7.d: "In a surprising diplomatic breakthrough, Germany and Russia have agreed to a joint administration of the Baltic region, forming the 'Baltic Alliance.' This pact ensures cooperation between the two powers and prevents immediate conflict, though many question whether such an uneasy partnership can truly last."

 baltic_events.8.d: "Germany has rejected [SOV.GetNameDef]’s offer of joint administration, insisting on direct control over the region. With tensions now at a breaking point, war seems increasingly likely.\n\nMilitary forces on both sides are mobilizing, and Europe watches nervously as another crisis threatens to spiral into full-scale conflict."

 # guarantees
 baltic_events.10.d: "With Germany and Russia forming an unlikely alliance over the Baltic region, the strategic situation in Europe has shifted dramatically. For years, we have maintained guarantees of independence for [SOV.GetNameDef] as a check against German influence.\n\nNow, with the two powers working together, some argue that continuing these guarantees is meaningless—and humiliating. The choice is ours."

 baltic_events.11.d: "Following the formation of the Baltic Alliance, [ROOT.GetName] decided to withdraw its guarantees towards [SOV.GetNameDef]. As St. Petersburg seems to have changed sides, old diplomatic arrangments were declared void. This development marks a major shift in European diplomacy, raising questions about the future balance of power on the continent."
