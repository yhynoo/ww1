 # intro event
 baltic_riot_events.1.d:0 "Riga has erupted into violence as angry crowds have taken to the streets, targeting German-owned businesses and homes. The resentment stems from long-standing ethnic tensions, economic hardship, and nationalist agitation. While the Russian authorities struggle to maintain order, Berlin watches with concern as ethnic Germans in the Baltic region face increasing hostility."

 # decision chain
 baltic_riot_events.2.d:0 "The recent violence in Riga has sparked outrage in Germany, with nationalist voices calling for intervention to protect the German community in the Baltic region.\n\nThe government now faces a crucial decision—should Germany issue an ultimatum to Russia, demand a protectorate, or stay out of the conflict altogether?"

 baltic_riot_events.3.d: "Reports of German military movements near the Russian border suggest that Berlin is preparing to take action in the Baltic region.\n\nGermany has signaled that it will not stand by while ethnic Germans face violence, and diplomatic channels are now abuzz with speculation over how [SOV.GetNameDef] will respond."

 baltic_riot_events.4.d: "The German government has formally demanded that [SOV.GetNameDef] recognize a German protectorate over the Baltic region, citing the need to protect ethnic Germans from further violence.\n\nThe Russian leadership must now decide whether to accept German oversight, propose an alternative solution, or refuse outright."

 baltic_riot_events.5.d: "In a surprising turn, the Russian government has agreed to [GER.GetNameDef]’s demands and formally ceded control over the Baltic territories. German officials are already overseeing the transition, with the new Baltic protectorate coming under Berlin’s administration.\n\nWhile some see this as a pragmatic move to avoid conflict, Russian nationalists view it as a national humiliation."

 # alliance
 baltic_riot_events.6.d: "Instead of simply handing over the Baltic region, [SOV.GetNameDef] has proposed an alternative—joint administration of the region under a Russo-German alliance.\n\nThis unprecedented offer could stabilize the area while ensuring cooperation between Berlin and St. Petersburg, but it remains to be seen whether the Germans will accept this compromise."

 baltic_riot_events.7.d: "In a surprising diplomatic breakthrough, Germany and Russia have agreed to a joint administration of the Baltic region, forming the 'Baltic Alliance.' This pact ensures cooperation between the two powers and prevents immediate conflict, though many question whether such an uneasy partnership can truly last."

 baltic_riot_events.8.d: "Germany has rejected [SOV.GetNameDef]’s offer of joint administration, insisting on direct control over the region. With tensions now at a breaking point, war seems increasingly likely.\n\nMilitary forces on both sides are mobilizing, and Europe watches nervously as another crisis threatens to spiral into full-scale conflict."

 # civil war
 baltic_civil_war.1.d: "In the forests and cities of the Baltic coast, a coalition of Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, and Baltic Germans has risen to cast off Russian domination. Declaring a united front for national liberation, local leaders have proclaimed a common struggle to restore self-rule to their homelands.\n\nFrom Tallinn to Vilnius, insurgents have taken up arms, seizing key towns and expelling Russian forces. The new movement pledges to defend freedom and sovereignty for all Baltic peoples, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Their message is unambiguous: the Russian Empire will no longer dictate their future."

 # german conquest
 baltic_german_conquest.1.d: "With German troops securing Riga and surrounding areas, the question now arises whether to establish a protectorate for the Baltic Germans.\n\nLong a prominent community in the region, they have expressed their willingness to aid in governance and defense. By formally recognizing their role, we can strengthen our position and ensure local stability through trusted leadership."

 baltic_german_conquest.2.d: "Following the arrival of German forces in Riga, a new protectorate has been established to represent and defend the interests of the Baltic German population.\n\nThe new administration, composed of local German leaders and supported by Berlin, has pledged to maintain order, support German operations in the region, and foster cooperation among the local communities."
