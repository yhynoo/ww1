  # airships
  germany_airships.1.d: "In a dazzling show of aerial might, airships of every shape and banner passed low over Johannisthal airfield today. Crowds cheered as crews saluted from gondolas, their great engines humming above the capital.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, the future of flight seemed both inevitable and elegant."

  # baltic
  germany_baltic.1.d: "Reports of riots and protests have emerged from Riga, with Livonian locals demanding greater autonomy from [SOV.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Ethnic Germans in the region have appealed to [GER.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for protection.\n\nThough unrest is still scattered, the situation may escalate quickly."

  germany_baltic.2.d: "Senior officials within the Foreign Office are debating whether to intervene in Livonia, citing cultural ties and regional stability. The military, still recovering from other campaigns, advises caution.\n\nYet public and press enthusiasm for protecting the Baltic Germans is rising."

  germany_baltic.3.d: "Germany has issued a formal note demanding the establishment of an autonomous protectorate in all the lands where Baltic German minority lives. The justification invokes historic ties and recent violence against non-Russian civilians.\n\nThe Russian response may determine whether peace holds — or fails — in the east."

  germany_baltic.4.d: "With Russian acquiescence, a new Baltic Duchy has been proclaimed under German protection. Provisional authorities, backed by Berlin, promise liberal reforms and regional peace.\n\nCelebrations in Mitau and Riga are cautious but genuine."

  germany_baltic.5.d: "The Russian government has refused Germany’s demand, calling it a violation of sovereignty and an insult to Slavic dignity. Mobilization orders are rumored in both Pskov and Königsberg.\n\nEurope holds its breath as the Baltic question threatens to spark a wider conflict."

  # bread
  germany_bread.1.d: "Bread prices have surged, and workers in Essen are no longer willing to endure empty tables and broken promises. Mass protests, led by trade unions and hungry families, have paralyzed the city’s industrial districts. Tension simmers: either the army intervenes, or concessions must be made."

  germany_bread.2.d: "What began as scattered protests turned deadly in Hamburg after troops opened fire near a crowded bakery queue. Dozens were killed or injured, with photographs already circulating in foreign newspapers.\n\nPublic trust in the government has taken a staggering blow."

  germany_bread.3.d: "The unrest has stirred deeper discontent, and anti-government leaflets now speak not just of hunger, but of change. Strikes have multiplied across the country, especially in the Ruhr and Rhineland.\n\nPolitical figures are calling for a national dialogue — or a new direction altogether."

  germany_bread.4.d: "A group of dissidents centered around journalist Kurt Eisner has established the Argonauten-Verein, declaring their intent to leave Germany behind in search of a freer, fairer life overseas.\n\nTheir departure is both a protest and a quiet scandal, especially among the press. Whether utopians or deserters, they capture the restless spirit of a nation adrift."

  germany_bread.5.d: "In an unprecedented session of the Reichstag, opposition members questioned whether the monarchy still holds the people’s confidence. Though framed cautiously, the implication was clear — reform, or abdicate.\n\nOutside the chamber, demonstrators chant slogans that just months ago would have been unthinkable."

  # egypt
  germany_egypt.1.d: "German archaeologists have unearthed a remarkable discovery deep in the sands of Egypt — a well-preserved statue believed to be of the legendary Queen Nefertiti herself. The find has ignited excitement among Berlin’s scholarly circles and stirred nationalist pride.\n\nThis triumph offers an opportunity to showcase Germany’s cultural prestige on the world stage, but it also raises delicate questions about the rightful ownership and the ancient mysteries that may come with disturbing such relics."

  germany_egypt.2.d: "Shortly after the statue's arrival in Berlin, rumors of an ancient curse have begun to spread among the populace and diplomatic circles alike.\n\nWhispers tell of misfortune befalling those who disturbed the queen’s resting place, casting a shadow of superstition over what should have been a moment of triumph. Though skepticism remains, the unease threatens to unsettle political stability at home."

  # metz
  germany_metz.1.d: "“Über Metz nach Paris!”, say the slogans painted on trains' skirts. Crowds gather in the streets, swept up in patriotic fervor as soldiers march off to cheers and brass bands.\n\nA swift, righteous war is promised — and the road to victory, they say, runs through Lorraine."

  # oriental
  germany_oriental.1.d: "Germany has proposed a substantial investment in key Turkish infrastructure, aiming to strengthen ties and secure economic influence in the region.\n\nThis offer promises improvements to transportation and logistics in strategic provinces, but the  government in Constantinople must weigh the benefits against the cost of foreign entanglements."

  germany_oriental.2.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has welcomed German investment, opening its doors to the expansion of infrastructure and trade.\n\nThis cooperation marks a significant step toward deeper economic integration and political alignment between the two empires, potentially reshaping regional dynamics."

  germany_oriental.3.d: "The Turkish government has declined Germany’s investment proposal, wary of increasing foreign control over its vital assets.\n\nThis rejection reflects ongoing concerns over sovereignty and the empire’s ability to navigate the pressures of competing great powers."

  germany_oriental.4.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] now seeks exclusive rights to extract Arabian oil within Ottoman territories.\n\nSecuring access to this valuable resource could fuel Germany’s industrial growth and military ambitions, but it also risks provoking rival powers who covet the same riches."

  germany_oriental.5.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has granted Germany access to Arabian oil fields, a deal that promises to bolster German energy supplies and economic strength.\n\nThis agreement signals a deepening partnership, but not without stirring unease among other regional and global stakeholders."

  germany_oriental.6.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has refused Germany’s request for oil concessions, prioritizing caution over immediate gain.\n\nThis refusal complicates Germany’s energy strategy and maintains a delicate balance of power in a region ripe for conflict."

  # south africa
  germany_south_africa.1.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has made a bold demand for control over South African territories currently held by [ENG.GetNameDef]. The rich resources and strategic position make these lands highly coveted.\n\nBritain must decide whether to cede these territories peacefully or prepare for conflict with a rising German power."

  germany_south_africa.2.d: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to transfer control of South African colonies to Germany, marking a significant shift in regional power.\n\nThis concession may ease tensions for now, but it sets a precedent that could reshape imperial boundaries across the globe."

  germany_south_africa.3.d: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] has firmly rejected Germany’s demands for South African territories, unwilling to give up these valuable holdings.\n\nThis refusal risks escalating into open conflict as both empires assert their interests in Africa."

  # thousand
  germany_thousand.1.d: "A stream of memoranda and rail traffic across the Bavarian border has caught the eye of Europe’s chancelleries. In Berlin, court intellectuals speak openly of Otto I's legacy, and the need to 'reestablish the foundation of the continent.'\n\nWhispers now reach Vienna: the Kaiser may seek to overwrite the Habsburg page in Germany’s sacred history."

  germany_thousand.2.d: "Envoys from Berlin have arrived in Paris bearing a parchment gilded with unfamiliar ambition. The proposal calls for a Carolingian pact — a fraternal resurrection of the western empire, guided by two kings, crowned by legacy, and shielded from the errors of modernity.\n\nFor the first time in centuries, the ghosts of Aachen are being asked to speak."

  germany_thousand.3.d: "Beneath the vaulted stones of Charlemagne’s chapel, a document was inked between [FROM.GetName] and [ROOT.GetName]. There were no brass bands or cannonades — only solemn silence, broken by prayers and signatures, as the Aachen Treaty was signed.\n\nObservers now speak of a new order in Europe: one similar to that from a thousand years ago."

  germany_thousand.4.d: "[FROM.GetName] has dismissed the proposal from [GER.GetName], denouncing it as a veiled power play in imperial vestments. Talks were aborted without ceremony; the emissaries returned to Berlin in silence.\n\nWhatever future the Carolingian dream held, it will not begin today."

  germany_thousand.5.d: "The treaty signed at Aachen lies in ruins, shattered by betrayal. What was meant to bring peace has only sown new hatred.\n\nIn [ROOT.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], fury builds. Those who broke faith will answer for it."
