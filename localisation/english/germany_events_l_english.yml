  # civil war
  germany_civil_war.1.d: "Discontent among the German fleet has exploded into open rebellion. Sailors, many of whom have been influenced by socialist agitators, have seized control of key vessels and ports, proclaiming the formation of a workers' and soldiers' council.\n\nAcross the empire, red flags are hoisted, and cracks begin to show in the once-proud Imperial order. Is this the spark of something larger?"

  germany_civil_war.2.d: "Reports from Berlin indicate that the Kaiser and his family have fled the capital under pressure from revolutionary forces. While their exact whereabouts remain unclear, rumors suggest they have gone into exile across the border.\n\nGermany now finds itself in uncharted waters — a nation without a crown, adrift in revolution."

  germany_civil_war.3.d: "Amid the civil strife shaking Germany, the region of Baden has broken away. Local royalist forces claim to defend the true legacy of the region, saying they cannot depend on Berlin anymore.\n\nFrom the Rhine Valley to the Black Forest, militias take up arms — another front in a fragmented Germany."

  germany_civil_war.4.d: "The Free State of Bavaria has been declared in Munich, separating itself from the revolutionary chaos gripping Berlin. Loyalist officers and conservative elements in the south are rallying under the white and blue flag, vowing to preserve order where the center has failed.\n\nYet even here, unity is far from guaranteed."

  germany_civil_war.5.d: "In Hanover, monarchist forces have taken up arms to resist the rising communist tide. Backed by local nobility and military officers loyal to the old order, they denounce the revolution as illegitimate.\n\nCalls for the restoration of the Kingdom of Hanover grow louder with every passing day."

  germany_civil_war.6.d: "The last barricades have fallen silent. After months of civil war, Germany's internal conflict has ended — though at a staggering cost. Cities lie in ruin, families remain divided, and trust in the state is at its lowest in living memory.\n\nThe guns may have stopped, but the true rebuilding has only just begun."

  germany_civil_war.7.d: "With the war concluded, discussions of reuniting the fractured German territories have begun. Leaders across the splintered lands debate whether a new unified Germany can emerge from the ashes — or whether independence is the price of stability.\n\nA decision must be made: reconciliation or separation?"

  germany_civil_war.8.d: "[FROM.GetName] has accepted the proposal for reunification. Despite the lingering wounds of the civil war, there is renewed hope that a stronger, more unified Germany can rise from the wreckage.\n\nThis act of trust may mark a turning point in postwar recovery."

  germany_civil_war.9.d: "[FROM.GetName] has declined the reunification proposal. The scars of war run too deep, and distrust of Berlin’s authority lingers still. For now, [FROM.GetName] will walk its own path, even as the fate of a divided Germany hangs in the balance."

  # egypt
  germany_egypt.1.d: "German archaeologists have unearthed a remarkable discovery deep in the sands of Egypt — a well-preserved statue believed to be of the legendary Queen Nefertiti herself. The find has ignited excitement among Berlin’s scholarly circles and stirred nationalist pride.\n\nThis triumph offers an opportunity to showcase Germany’s cultural prestige on the world stage, but it also raises delicate questions about the rightful ownership and the ancient mysteries that may come with disturbing such relics."

  germany_egypt.2.d: "Shortly after the statue's arrival in Berlin, rumors of an ancient curse have begun to spread among the populace and diplomatic circles alike.\n\nWhispers tell of misfortune befalling those who disturbed the queen’s resting place, casting a shadow of superstition over what should have been a moment of triumph. Though skepticism remains, the unease threatens to unsettle political stability at home."

  # feuerland
  germany_feuerland.1.d: "The prolonged war has pushed Essen’s industrial workforce beyond its breaking point. Widespread strikes have brought production to a halt, with workers demanding relief from grueling conditions and food shortages.\n\nThe government must decide: crush dissent with force or attempt to ease the suffering — before the situation spirals further."

  germany_feuerland.2.d: "Reports from cities across Germany paint a grim picture. As supplies dwindle and hunger deepens, malnutrition has taken root among the urban poor. Riots and unrest seem inevitable unless urgent measures are taken.\n\nThe cost of the war is now felt not only at the front, but on every street corner."

  # haase
  germany_haase.1.d: "Amid rising social unrest, Wilhelm Haase has delivered a stirring address to the German populace, calling for unity and mutual understanding between the government and the growing socialist movement.\n\nHis words resonate with many who seek reform and workers’ rights, but also alarm conservative factions wary of revolutionary fervor. The government now faces a crucial choice in how to respond."

  germany_haase.2.d: "A Committee for Mutual Agreement has been formed, composed of representatives from both the government and socialist leaders.\n\nThis rare gesture toward dialogue offers hope for easing tensions and crafting reforms that could stabilize the nation. Yet deep distrust lingers on both sides, threatening to unravel negotiations at the slightest provocation."

  germany_haase.3.d: "Strikes have erupted across the Hamburg docks, bringing commerce to a halt and signaling the increasing power of labor movements inspired by Haase’s rhetoric.\n\nThe government is pressured to respond swiftly — whether through dialogue or force — as the unrest threatens to spread to other industrial centers, risking nationwide paralysis."

  germany_haase.4.d: "Emergency talks convene in Charlottenburg, where leaders from both sides grapple with the demands of workers and the imperatives of state order.\n\nThough the conference halts immediate violence, underlying grievances remain unaddressed, and the fragile peace may yet shatter under future strain."

  germany_haase.5.d: "Karl Liebknecht, a passionate advocate for the workers and an influential figure in the socialist movement, has been killed under suspicious circumstances.\n\nHis death sends shockwaves through Germany, sparking outrage and grief among his supporters. The political landscape grows ever more volatile, with the potential for violent upheaval looming on the horizon."

  # oriental
  germany_oriental.1.d: "Germany has proposed a substantial investment in key Turkish infrastructure, aiming to strengthen ties and secure economic influence in the region.\n\nThis offer promises improvements to transportation and logistics in strategic provinces, but the  government in Constantinople must weigh the benefits against the cost of foreign entanglements."

  germany_oriental.2.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has welcomed German investment, opening its doors to the expansion of infrastructure and trade.\n\nThis cooperation marks a significant step toward deeper economic integration and political alignment between the two empires, potentially reshaping regional dynamics."

  germany_oriental.3.d: "The Turkish government has declined Germany’s investment proposal, wary of increasing foreign control over its vital assets.\n\nThis rejection reflects ongoing concerns over sovereignty and the empire’s ability to navigate the pressures of competing great powers."

  germany_oriental.4.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] now seeks exclusive rights to extract Arabian oil within Ottoman territories.\n\nSecuring access to this valuable resource could fuel Germany’s industrial growth and military ambitions, but it also risks provoking rival powers who covet the same riches."

  germany_oriental.5.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has granted Germany access to Arabian oil fields, a deal that promises to bolster German energy supplies and economic strength.\n\nThis agreement signals a deepening partnership, but not without stirring unease among other regional and global stakeholders."

  germany_oriental.6.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has refused Germany’s request for oil concessions, prioritizing caution over immediate gain.\n\nThis refusal complicates Germany’s energy strategy and maintains a delicate balance of power in a region ripe for conflict."

  # south africa
  germany_south_africa.1.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has made a bold demand for control over South African territories currently held by [ENG.GetNameDef]. The rich resources and strategic position make these lands highly coveted.\n\nBritain must decide whether to cede these territories peacefully or prepare for conflict with a rising German power."

  germany_south_africa.2.d: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to transfer control of South African colonies to Germany, marking a significant shift in regional power.\n\nThis concession may ease tensions for now, but it sets a precedent that could reshape imperial boundaries across the globe."

  germany_south_africa.3.d: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] has firmly rejected Germany’s demands for South African territories, unwilling to give up these valuable holdings.\n\nThis refusal risks escalating into open conflict as both empires assert their interests in Africa."

  # thousand
  germany_thousand.1.d: "A stream of memoranda and rail traffic across the Bavarian border has caught the eye of Europe’s chancelleries. In Berlin, court intellectuals speak openly of Otto I's legacy, and the need to 'reestablish the foundation of the continent.'\n\nWhispers now reach Vienna: the Kaiser may seek to overwrite the Habsburg page in Germany’s sacred history."

  germany_thousand.2.d: "Envoys from Berlin have arrived in Paris bearing a parchment gilded with unfamiliar ambition. The proposal calls for a Carolingian pact — a fraternal resurrection of the western empire, guided by two kings, crowned by legacy, and shielded from the errors of modernity.\n\nFor the first time in centuries, the ghosts of Aachen are being asked to speak."

  germany_thousand.3.d: "Beneath the vaulted stones of Charlemagne’s chapel, a document was inked between [FROM.GetName] and [ROOT.GetName]. There were no brass bands or cannonades — only solemn silence, broken by prayers and signatures, as the Aachen Treaty was signed.\n\nObservers now speak of a new order in Europe: one similar to that from a thousand years ago."

  germany_thousand.4.d: "[FROM.GetName] has dismissed the proposal from [GER.GetName], denouncing it as a veiled power play in imperial vestments. Talks were aborted without ceremony; the emissaries returned to Berlin in silence.\n\nWhatever future the Carolingian dream held, it will not begin today."

  germany_thousand.5.d: "The treaty signed at Aachen lies in ruins, shattered by betrayal. What was meant to bring peace has only sown new hatred.\n\nIn [ROOT.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], fury builds. Those who broke faith will answer for it."
