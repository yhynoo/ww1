  # Anarchist Trials
  france_anarchist_trials.1.d: "A wave of arrests has swept through Paris following a series of anarchist demonstrations and attacks in the latter half of last year. The French government now faces a critical decision: how to handle the trials of these radical suspects.\n\nPublic opinion is sharply divided between those calling for transparency and those demanding swift, quiet justice."
  france_anarchist_trials.2.d: "The trials of prominent anarchist figures have opened in the grand Palais de Justice. Journalists and citizens pack the courtroom as dramatic testimonies unfold.\n\nWith tensions high, the government's management of the proceedings could shape France’s image abroad—and its stability at home."
  france_anarchist_trials.3.d: "The French government’s firm handling of the anarchist trials has won praise at home and abroad. With the proceedings conducted openly, the ideology behind the violence has been widely condemned.\n\nLiberal and democratic factions hail the outcome as a victory for order and the rule of law."
  france_anarchist_trials.4.d: "Though intended as a demonstration of justice, the anarchist trials have instead exposed deep fractures within French society. Left-wing groups condemn the proceedings as political repression, while government supporters argue they were necessary.\n\nThe spectacle has become a global controversy, casting doubt on France’s internal cohesion."

  # Anarchist Opposition in France
  france_anarchist_opposition.1.d: "After the sensational trials of 1912, controversy still swirls around the heavy-handed approach the liberal government took against the anarchist agitators.\n\nRenewed interest in revisiting the trial grows, particularly among the youth and in university circles."
  france_anarchist_opposition.2.d: "A series of anonymous pamphlets have circulated in Paris and Marseille, warning of 'retribution for the martyrs of repression.' Intelligence services suspect coordinated action from underground anarchist networks.\n\nWhether to respond with arrests or caution remains a contentious issue within the government."
  france_anarchist_opposition.3.d: "Senator Laurent Desroux was gunned down this morning in broad daylight on the Avenue de l’Opéra. The assailant disappeared into the crowd. While no group has claimed responsibility, the attack bears hallmarks of anarchist violence.\n\nNational outrage is mounting, seemingly marking the end of the recent surge in sympathy for the anarchist movement."
  france_anarchist_opposition.4.d: "Anna Estorges, a known anarchist who avoided persecution in the 1912 trials, has penned a searing editorial in *Le Matin*. In it, she condemns state violence, defends the memory of past acticists, and warns of a future shaped by unresolved injustices.\n\nSupporters hail her as a brave voice for the voiceless. Others demand her immediate arrest."
  france_anarchist_opposition.5.d: "A wave of sympathetic journalism and street protests has followed Estorges’ publication. In some quarters, radicalized youth now wear black ribbons on their jackets, symbolizing violent resistance against the state.\n\nIs this the beginning of a cultural reckoning — or the early stages of another insurgency?"
  france_anarchist_opposition.6.d: "A self-declared anarchist commune has seized control of Lille’s city hall and police stations. Black flags fly above government buildings as local officials either flee or defect.

This diplomatic victory marks French return to activity in the region, bringing relief in both Paris and Brussels.\n\nAcross Europe, leaders are taking note of France's growing assertiveness on the world stage."
  france_events.3.d: "In a surprising move, the Dutch government has refused France's demands to leave Belgium, escalating tensions between the two nations.\n\nThis rejection is seen as unexpected, as The Hague had repeatedly asked the French to assume control over Belgium in the past months. Observers fear the dispute may ignite broader instability in the near future."

This concession is celebrated as a major diplomatic success for France and a step toward regional stability. \n\nEuropean observers commend the peaceful resolution of a tense situation."
  france_events.6.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has refused to comply with France’s ultimatum regarding Belgium, plunging relations into turmoil.

The region remains in an uneasy state of limbo."

  # Annex Belgium

  # Alliances
  france_colombia.1.d: "Diplomatic envoys from [FRA.GetNameDef] have arrived with an unexpected offer: a formal military alliance.\n\nWhile French interest in Colombian internal politics appears limited, Paris views Bogotá as a potential strategic partner in challenging Anglo-American dominance in the Western Hemisphere. They frame the proposal as a bold new chapter in Franco-Latin solidarity."
  france_colombia.2.d: "France and Colombia have agreed to a formal military alliance. Though separated by an ocean and differing political traditions, the two nations appear united by a shared desire to reconfigure the geopolitical balance in the Americas.\n\nWashington has expressed concern over this development, calling it a destabilizing intrusion by European powers into its traditional sphere of influence."

  france_colombia.4.d: "[COL.GetNameDefCap] and France have signed a mutual defense pact.\n\nWhile falling short of a full alliance, the agreement strengthens French influence in the Americas and signals Colombia’s willingness to engage with European powers on matters of mutual security."
  france_colombia.5.d: "Negotiations with Colombia have collapsed. Despite shared strategic interests, disagreements over internal sovereignty and fears of provoking American retaliation led Bogotá to walk away. France, frustrated by the lack of commitment, has called the talks a missed opportunity."
  france_colombia.6.d: "Colombia has rejected France’s offer of alliance.\n\nWhile diplomatic ties remain cordial, Bogotá has clearly signaled its reluctance to become entangled in European power struggles or to provoke even more tensions with the United States."

  france_england.1.d: "Following years of diplomatic coordination, [FRA.GetNameDef] has proposed a formal alliance to solidify the understandings of the Entente Cordiale.\n\nCiting growing instability in Europe and the rise of aggressive continental powers, they argue that only a binding military alliance can ensure the security of Western Europe and the maintenance of global balance."
  france_england.2.d: "[FRA.GetNameDefCap] and [ENG.GetNameDef] have entered into a formal alliance, transforming the Entente Cordiale into a true military partnership. What began as colonial diplomacy has now evolved into strategic alignment, primarily aimed at containing the colonial expansion of [GER.GetNameDef].\n\nMany in Europe see this as the final death knell of British splendid isolation."
  france_england.3.d: "While rejecting a full military alliance, [ENG.GetNameDef] has proposed a more limited defensive pact. They stress their commitment to continental stability but remain cautious about entanglements that might compromise their global naval posture or independence of action."
  france_england.4.d: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] and [FRA.GetNameDef] have signed a mutual defense agreement, pledging to support one another in case of unprovoked aggression.\n\nThough falling short of a full alliance, the pact is a significant deepening of cooperation and signals [ENG.GetNameDef]'s growing willingness to commit to continental security."
  france_england.5.d: "Talks between [ENG.GetNameDef] and [FRA.GetNameDef] have collapsed.

  france_england.6.d: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] has declined the offer of a formal alliance. While the Entente remains in place as a diplomatic understanding, there will be no military guarantees between the two powers — at least for the time being."

  france_russia.1.d: "Amid rising tensions in Europe, [FRA.GetNameDef] has proposed a formal military alliance. This move would deepen the long-standing Franco-Russian understanding and present a united continental front against the perceived threat of Central European hegemony.\n\nWhile the cooperation with [ENG.GetNameDef] remains informal, this would mark a pivot eastward in French strategy."
  france_russia.2.d: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to formalize its alliance with [FRA.GetNameDef], reinforcing the longstanding Franco-Russian cooperation with explicit military commitments.\n\nThe new alliance strengthens the eastern and western flanks of the continent and sends a clear signal to those who might seek continental domination."
  france_russia.3.d: "Though wary of binding themselves too tightly, [SOV.GetNameDef] has proposed a system of mutual guarantees instead of a full alliance. They argue this arrangement will preserve flexibility while still serving as a deterrent to aggression."
  france_russia.4.d: "A treaty of mutual defense has been signed between [FRA.GetNameDef] and [SOV.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile not as far-reaching as a formal alliance, this agreement ensures that either nation will respond to threats against the other — a clear message to any power contemplating aggression."
  france_russia.5.d: "Alliance negotiations between [FRA.GetNameDef] and [SOV.GetNameDef] have failed. Despite shared interests and history, political hesitation and differing strategic priorities proved insurmountable."
  france_russia.6.d: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has declined the proposed alliance with [FRA.GetNameDef], citing a desire to avoid deeper entanglements. The decision casts uncertainty over the future of Franco-Russian cooperation in the face of mounting continental tensions."

  # Across the Atlantic

  # Restore the Ancien Regime

  france_ancien_regime.2.d: "The intellectual community has begun to resist the creeping influence of monarchist ideology. Humanists and republicans within the Academy denounce the return of reactionary politics, stirring heated debate in salons and lecture halls across the country.\n\nThe government must decide: suppress dissent or allow the republic's critics to speak freely."
  france_ancien_regime.3.d: "The so-called 'Orléans Dossier' has been quietly accepted by senior government officials. Though not a literal document, the phrase refers to a new political arrangement granting the House of Orleans significant sovereign authority — over foreign policy, military command, and fiscal oversight — while leaving domestic governance to parliament.\n\nBeing a de facto restoration of French monarchy, the supporters hail it as the beginning of a stable and divinely sanctioned order."
  france_ancien_regime.4.d: "Mass demonstrations have erupted in cities across France, denouncing the clergy’s growing influence in politics. Accusations of corruption and collusion with monarchist circles have triggered a new wave of anti-clerical fervor.\n\nThe republic must decide whether to defend the Church — or distance itself from it to preserve legitimacy."

  france_ancien_regime.6.d: "Reports from Paris suggest that royalist forces have declared an end to the Republic, aiming to restore the monarchy under an absolutist regime.

  france_let_them_eat_cake.4.d: "The Franco-Spanish Union has sparked international controversy, with protests erupting from major powers like [ROOT.GetName].

The possibility of a new Bourbon-controlled Italian state may be within reach, but it would certainly ignite a fierce conflict with Italy."
