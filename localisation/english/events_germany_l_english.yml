  # Nefertiti
  germany_nefertiti.1.d: "A team of German archaeologists has announced the discovery of a stunning bust believed to depict Queen Nefertiti, unearthed during an excavation in Egypt. The find is being hailed as a triumph of German scholarship and a symbol of national prestige.\n\nThe question now is whether the artifact should be brought back to Berlin or remain under the authority of the Ottoman Empire."
  germany_nefertiti.2.d: "Germany’s decision to sneakily transport the Nefertiti bust back to Berlin has sparked diplomatic friction. Ottoman officials have expressed outrage, accusing the Germans of exploiting a power imbalance to plunder cultural treasures.\n\nThe controversy threatens to sour relations between Berlin and Constantinople, with the latter now considering expelling German archaeologists from other site they currently occupy, such as Warka in Iraq."
  germany_nefertiti.3.d: "The transfer of the recently excavated Nefertiti bust to Germany has ignited international debate about the ethics of archaeology under imperial rule. While German officials showcase the artifact as a testament to national greatness, critics around the world accuse Berlin of cultural theft.\n\nSome foreign newspapers have even invoked talk of an 'ancient curse' — a metaphor for the diplomatic blowback Germany now faces over its handling of a priceless relic from another civilization."

  # Oriental Investments
  germany_oriental.1.d: "The German Empire has proposed a grand infrastructure project: the Kaiserliche Eisenbahn, a modern railway stretching through Ottoman territory to strengthen economic ties and increase trade efficiency.\n\nGerman engineers and investors stand ready to begin construction, but some within the government warn that accepting the project could increase Berlin’s influence over our affairs. Should we proceed?"
  germany_oriental.2.d: "The Ottoman Empire has agreed to Germany’s proposal to construct the Kaiserliche Eisenbahn, a major railway connecting key regions under Turkish control. German investment and expertise will drive the project, further strengthening economic and diplomatic ties between the two empires.\n\nSome observers see this as a strategic shift, with the Ottomans moving closer to Berlin’s sphere of influence."
  germany_oriental.3.d: "The Ottoman Empire has rejected Germany’s proposal to invest in the Kaiserliche Eisenbahn, opting to maintain its autonomy in infrastructure development.\n\nThis decision may strain relations with Berlin, but it ensures that the Ottomans will not become too dependent on German influence."
  
  germany_oriental.4.d: "With German investment flowing into the empire, some voices within the government argue that securing formal German guarantees would provide a stronger defense against potential aggressors.\n\nOthers warn that such a move would compromise Ottoman sovereignty. Should we approach Berlin for protection?"
  germany_oriental.5.d: "The Ottoman government has officially requested that Germany extend military guarantees over their empire. They argue that the growing strategic partnership between our nations justifies a formal commitment to their defense.\n\nSome in the Reichstag see this as an opportunity to expand German influence, while others caution against entanglement in Ottoman affairs."
  germany_oriental.6.d: "Germany has accepted the Ottoman request for military guarantees, solidifying their strategic partnership. Berlin has pledged to defend Ottoman territorial integrity, a move that is seen as a major diplomatic shift.\n\nThis new alignment is sure to raise concerns among other great powers."
  germany_oriental.7.d: "Germany has declined the Ottoman request for military guarantees. While Berlin remains committed to economic cooperation, the Reichstag has decided that formal military obligations in the region are too risky.\n\nThis rejection leaves the Ottomans to fend for themselves in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape."
  
  germany_oriental.8.d: "The German Empire has approached us with a proposal to invest in the untapped oil reserves of southern Iraq.\n\nThey claim this will modernize our industry and provide us with much-needed revenue, but some advisors worry about granting foreign powers influence over our resources. Should we allow German drilling operations?"
  germany_oriental.9.d: "The Ottoman Empire has agreed to allow German companies to begin drilling for oil in the Arabian Peninsula. This deal brings much-needed capital to the Ottomans, but some fear it will lead to increased German influence in the region.\n\nNonetheless, the economic boost could be invaluable for the Ottoman economy."
  germany_oriental.10.d: "The Ottoman Empire has rejected German investment in Arabian oil, opting to retain full control over its natural resources.\n\nWhile this decision maintains Ottoman economic independence, it may strain relations with Berlin, which had sought a deeper stake in the region."

  # Place in the Sun
  germany_place_in_the_sun.1.d: "Germany has decided to take a more assertive stance in southern Africa, demanding that South Africa and Bechuanaland be placed under German control. This move comes in the wake of growing German ambitions to expand its colonial holdings and challenge the dominance of the British Empire in the region.\n\nThe question now is whether Germany should attempt to involve the Dutch, or if it should press forward on its own to secure these territories."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.2.d: "The Hague is faced with a critical decision regarding Germany's demand for South Africa and Bechuanaland. A significant part of the public is still outraged by English atrocities commited against the Dutch-descendant Boers during the recent war, or remain neutral and let Germany act independently?\n\nTheir response will shape the course of the diplomatic situation and could influence the future of European colonial power in the region."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.3.d: "The Dutch have made their decision, and they have refused to get involved in Germany's demand for South Africa and Bechuanaland. This leaves Germany with the option of either moving forward on its own or abandoning the claim entirely.\n\nThe failure to gain Dutch support could isolate Germany in this ambitious endeavor, but the path forward is still open."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.4.d: "With the Dutch agreeing to support Germany's claims on South Africa and Bechuanaland, the diplomatic pressure now shifts to England. The British Empire must decide whether to accept Germany's demands and risk weakening its hold on its colonies, or if they will stand firm and resist the German threat.\n\nThe outcome of this decision will have far-reaching consequences for both British and German interests in Africa."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.5.d: "Germany has decided to press its claims for South Africa and Bechuanaland unilaterally, bypassing the Dutch and asserting its dominance in the region. England is now faced with a choice: accept Germany's territorial demands or risk a larger diplomatic confrontation.\n\nThis could lead to an escalation in tensions between the two empires, and the balance of power in Africa could be irrevocably altered."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.6.d: "England has agreed to Germany's demands, ceding control of South Africa and Bechuanaland to German rule. This marks a significant shift in the colonial landscape of southern Africa and demonstrates Germany's growing influence in the region.\n\nThe diplomatic victory for Germany will reverberate across Europe, signaling a new phase of colonial rivalry in Africa."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.7.d: "After careful consideration, the British Empire has reluctantly agreed to Germany's territorial demands in South Africa and Bechuanaland. This outcome is a major diplomatic victory for Germany, which now gains significant influence over these important territories.\n\nThe decision could lead to a realignment of European powers, as Germany strengthens its position as a colonial empire in Africa."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.8.d: "England has decisively rejected Germany's demands for South Africa and Bechuanaland, standing firm against what it views as an unwarranted challenge to its imperial authority. This rejection escalates the diplomatic crisis and puts both empires on a collision course.\n\nThe refusal could ignite further tensions and spark a wider conflict over colonial holdings in Africa."

  germany_place_in_the_sun.9.d: "Germany has proposed a formal alliance with [ROOT.GetName], aiming to strengthen the Central European powers. This alliance could shift the balance of power in Europe, with both nations reaping the benefits of mutual support and security.\n\n[ROOT.GetName] must now decide whether to join this growing partnership or pursue a different path."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.10.d: "[ROOT.GetName] has agreed to join Germany's alliance, solidifying a new and powerful partnership in Central Europe. The two nations now stand united, ready to face the challenges of a turbulent Europe together.\n\nThis move will have significant ramifications for the diplomatic landscape, as the balance of power shifts in favor of the Central Powers."
  germany_place_in_the_sun.11.d: "[FROM.GetName] has rejected Germany's offer of an alliance, choosing to pursue its own path in Europe. The rejection marks a significant shift in [FROM.GetName]'s foreign policy, potentially isolating the nation from one of Europe’s strongest powers.\n\nThis decision may lead [FROM.GetName] to seek other alliances or stand alone in the face of increasing tensions."

  # Look to the East
  germany_look_to_the_east.1.d: "Germany has proposed a strategic alliance to [MAN.GetNameDef], aiming to enhance diplomatic and military relations. This offer comes as both nations recognize the growing significance of their respective positions in global politics.\n\n[MAN.GetName] now faces a crucial decision: whether to accept the alliance and align with Germany or reject the proposal and pursue a different course."
  germany_look_to_the_east.2.d: "[MAN.GetName] has agreed to join Germany’s alliance, marking a significant shift in the balance of power in Asia. This new alignment strengthens the Central Powers in Asia, with both empires poised to increase their diplomatic and military cooperation.\n\n[MAN.GetName] now finds itself at the forefront of a European-backed Asian bloc."
  germany_look_to_the_east.3.d: "[MAN.GetName] has declined Germany’s offer of an alliance, preferring to maintain its independence and avoid external entanglements.\n\nThis decision represents a missed opportunity for Germany to extend its influence in Asia, and the Chinese may seek alternative alliances or remain neutral in the growing global tensions."
  germany_look_to_the_east.4.d: "In a provocative statement broadcast across the globe, Germany has openly voiced support for independence movements within London's empire, specifically calling out India and Australia as nations that deserve self-determination.\n\nFramed as a stand for liberty and national sovereignty, Berlin’s rhetoric is widely seen as a strategic attempt to undermine the imperial authority of [ENG.GetNameDef] and stoke unrest in its dominions. London is expected to respond sharply."

  # Am Landwehrkanal
  germany_landwehrkanal.1.d: "Reports from Berlin and Leipzig speak of pamphlets, student demonstrations, and clandestine workers’ meetings — all bearing the mark of a resurgent communist underground. Their rhetoric is anti-war, anti-authority, and increasingly anti-democratic.\n\nWhile some in the cabinet urge calm and reform, others demand immediate action. Is this mere posturing from radicals, or the first stirrings of something greater?"
  germany_landwehrkanal.2.d: "A wave of arrests has swept through the activist community, targeting those accused of agitating against the ongoing democratic reforms. Among those detained are pacifist intellectuals, known trade unionists, and several former members of the Spartakus League.\n\nThe operation has drawn criticism from liberal circles, who see it as a crackdown on dissent rather than justice. But monarchist factions are emboldened, demanding even harsher measures."
  germany_landwehrkanal.3.d: "Julian Marchlewski and several of his closest associates have reportedly fled to Denmark, citing threats of arrest and political persecution. Their departure follows weeks of surveillance and pressure from state authorities.\n\nGovernment loyalists are calling it a victory, claiming the exile proves the state’s resolve. But others fear it may turn these dissidents into martyrs for the left."
  germany_landwehrkanal.4.d: "A public trial has begun against August Thalheimer, a prominent theorist accused of inciting unrest through his writings and associations. The prosecution claims he coordinated with communist cells, while the defense insists the charges are politically motivated.\n\nDebate rages over whether this trial is about justice or making an example. The eyes of the nation — and of Europe — are watching closely."
  germany_landwehrkanal.5.d: "Karl Liebknecht's body was pulled from the Landwehrkanal this morning. The official report claims accidental drowning — a tragic end for a controversial figure. But bruises, lacerations, and the absence of water in his lungs suggest something far more sinister.\n\nWord of the cover-up is already spreading. To many, this is not just a death, but an execution disguised as misfortune. The myth of Liebknecht may prove more powerful than the man ever was."
  germany_landwehrkanal.6.d: "Armed uprisings have erupted across Germany following Liebknecht’s death. Workers’ councils across the country have taken up arms, declaring the end of imperial rule and the beginning of a socialist republic.\n\nThe government, divided and reeling, scrambles to contain the revolt. It is no longer a matter of protest — it is civil war."

  # Weimar Constitution
  germany_weimar_constitution.4.d: "With the establishment of the Afrikahandelsamt, Germany aims to strengthen its influence in Africa and improve coordination of its colonial affairs. This new institution will oversee Germany’s African territories and their development, enhancing the efficiency of governance and resource management.\n\nThe move marks a significant step in Germany’s ambition to assert its role as a colonial power on the continent."

  # Namibia
  germany_developments_in_namibia.1.d: "The discovery and expansion of diamond mining in South-West Africa has created new opportunities for economic gain and strategic development.\n\nGerman officials must now decide whether to exploit these riches for immediate industrial benefit or invest in the long-term development of the colony."
  germany_developments_in_namibia.2.d: "German-owned mining companies have rapidly expanded operations in South-West Africa, extracting vast quantities of diamonds and minerals for export. While Berlin celebrates the boost to its economy, correspondents notice that it all happens at the expense of the indigenous populations — conjuring up the horrifying images from recent Herero war."
  germany_developments_in_namibia.3.d: "A new harbor has opened at Walfischbucht, significantly improving South-West Africa’s trade and naval access.\n\nColonial officials praise this as a sign of enlightened colonial policy, citing the project as a model for sustainable development in Africa."
  germany_developments_in_namibia.4.d: "The success of development efforts in South-West Africa has drawn attention to the dark legacy of the Herero and Nama uprisings.\n\nJournalists and local administrators are again speaking about atrocities committed during the recent colonial campaigns, prompting uncomfortable questions in Berlin."
  germany_developments_in_namibia.5.d: "Citing the ambition of developing the colony of South-West Africa together with the indigenous populations, German authorities have publicly acknowledged responsibility for war crimes committed against the Herero and Nama peoples in years 1904-1908.\n\nThough some commend the gesture, others note that true justice remains elusive. The shadow of Germany’s actions will haunt the colony for years to come."
