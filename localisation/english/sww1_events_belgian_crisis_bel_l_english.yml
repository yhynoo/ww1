 belgian_crisis_bel.1.d:0 "With France now firmly in control of both Flanders and Wallonia, the chaotic Belgian crisis appears to have reached a turning point. What began as a collapse of Belgian governance has now been replaced by direct French administration.\n\nWhile tensions remain, many European diplomats hope this will prevent further instability in the region. However, questions linger—will Belgium ever return to full independence, or is it now simply an extension of French rule?"

 belgian_crisis_bel.2.d:0 "After months of uncertainty, France has declared Belgium a demilitarized zone under its protection, pledging to maintain peace and order. Paris insists this is not an annexation but a necessary step to ensure stability in the region.\n\nReactions are mixed—some hope this compromise will ease tensions, while others suspect [FRA.capital.GetName] has simply rebranded its occupation. Will the great powers accept this arrangement, or is another confrontation on the horizon?"

 belgian_crisis_bel.3.d:0 "In a shocking move, [FRA.GetName] has formally proclaimed the full annexation of Belgium, ending any pretense of temporary administration. The international community is in uproar, with Germany and Britain condemning the action as a blatant violation of European order.\n\nWhile [FRA.capital.GetName] insists this secures stability in the region, critics warn that France has overstepped, potentially triggering a new diplomatic crisis—or worse. Will other powers accept this fait accompli?"
