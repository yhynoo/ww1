  # events
  x_aachen.1.d: "As reported by our government, [FROM.GetNameDefCap], encouraged by the signing of the Treaty of Aachen, presents its territorial demands. Their envoys speak of peace — if only these territories are surrendered.\n\nOur nation faces a grave choice: submit to humiliation, or risk everything in defiance."

  x_aachen.2.d: "[FROM.GetName] yields to [ROOT.GetAdjective] pressure, signing away the contested lands beneath the shadow of the Franco-German Aachen Treaty. No victory parades mark this moment — only the quiet shame of retreat, as borders are redrawn by foreign hands.\n\nEurope holds its breath, for the old balance has shifted, and a new order begins to take shape."

  x_aachen.3.d: "[FROM.GetName] refuses to surrender a single province, rejecting [ROOT.GetName]'s demands outright. Their leaders vow to resist any attempt at conquest.\n\nThe path to war now seems unavoidable."

  x_aachen.4.d: "Bourbon loyalists have risen in southern Italy, seizing towns and rallying those embittered by unification. Royalist banners fly once more over Naples and Calabria, as old dynasties seek to reclaim what was lost.\n\nFor France, this unrest offers a chance to match German gains under the Aachen Treaty — and perhaps reshape Italy’s future in its image."
