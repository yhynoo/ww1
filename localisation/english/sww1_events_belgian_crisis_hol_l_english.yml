 belgian_crisis_hol.1.d:0 "A diplomatic proposal from Paris has arrived—France is offering to take control of Flanders, arguing that Dutch governance over the region has proven unsustainable. With Belgium’s collapse and The Hague’s authority weakened after the military intervention, France insists that stabilizing Flanders is in everyone’s best interest.\n\nMany in the Dutch government are hesitant. Ceding control to France would reduce international pressure but also signal weakness. Others argue that holding on to Flanders is impossible in the long run. The fate of the region now hangs in the balance."

 belgian_crisis_hol.2.d:0 "A diplomatic resolution to the Belgian crisis may finally be in sight. The Dutch government has officially ceded control of Flanders to France, hoping to stabilize the region after months of uncertainty and unrest.\n\nThe move has been met with quiet approval from the international community. Many had doubted The Hague’s ability to govern Flanders effectively, and French administration is seen as a more stable solution—at least for now."

 belgian_crisis_hol.3.d:0 "In an unexpected move, the Dutch government has declined our offer to assume control of Flanders. Given their already fragile hold on the region and the broader collapse of Belgian governance, the decision has baffled many in Paris.\n\nWith Dutch leadership still in turmoil after their ill-fated intervention in Belgium, it is unclear how The Hague intends to maintain control. Meanwhile, unrest in Flanders continues to grow, and the situation remains dangerously unstable."
