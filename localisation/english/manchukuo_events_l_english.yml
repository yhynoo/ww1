  # hong kong
  manchukuo_hong_kong.1.d: "In a bold rejection of colonial-era arrangements, [MAN.GetNameDef] has declared the 99-year lease of the New Territories null and void, calling the entire Hong Kong Agreement 'a relic of imperial coercion.'\n\nFraming their demand as the end of an unequal treaty forced upon China after the Opium Wars, [MAN.GetAdjective] officials insist that full sovereignty over Hong Kong must be restored immediately."

  manchukuo_hong_kong.2.d: "Citing changing geopolitical realities and mounting diplomatic pressure, British forces have begun a staged withdrawal from Hong Kong. The once-colonial outpost—acquired in the aftermath of the First Opium War—now returns to Chinese hands without a shot fired.\n\nCrowds gather in Victoria Harbour to witness the lowering of the Union Jack, marking the end of over a century of British rule."

  manchukuo_hong_kong.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has rejected the demand to relinquish control over Hong Kong, dismissing it as an illegal and opportunistic move.

  # shandong
  manchukuo_shandong.1.d: "In a dramatic escalation, [MAN.GetNameDef] has issued an ultimatum demanding the immediate transfer of Tsingtao and surrounding territories, citing historic claims and the need to expel foreign influence from Chinese soil.\n\nThe demand has sent shockwaves through diplomatic circles, as Germany weighs the cost of defiance against the risk of losing its prized foothold in East Asia."

  manchukuo_shandong.2.d: "Under growing pressure and unwilling to risk a costly conflict in the Far East, German forces have begun withdrawing from their positions in Tsingtao and Shandong. [MAN.GetNameDef] marches triumphantly into the abandoned settlements, greeted by cheering crowds.\n\nThis bloodless victory bolsters [MAN.GetAdjective] prestige and marks a turning point in the struggle to restore Chinese sovereignty."

  manchukuo_shandong.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has flatly rejected [MAN.GetNameDef]’s ultimatum, refusing to abandon its colonial outposts in Shandong. German garrisons prepare for war, determined to defend their holdings against what they call 'an unlawful and hostile provocation.'\n\nWith diplomacy exhausted, the specter of armed conflict looms large over the region."
