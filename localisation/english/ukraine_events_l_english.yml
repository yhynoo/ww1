  # steppe
  ukraine_steppe.1.d: "Whispers from Kyiv speak of new horizons, as voices in government and among the Cossack hosts call for expansion eastward. They evoke the memory of the free riders of the steppe, guardians of the frontier who once shaped these lands.\n\nAs Ukraine looks beyond its borders, questions arise about destiny, duty, and the promise of the open plains."

A prince by birth but a Cossack at heart, he pledges his sword and lineage to the Ukrainian cause.\n\nHis presence stirs both hope and curiosity among those seeking a champion in troubled times."
