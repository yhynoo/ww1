  # agitation
  soviet_agitation.1.d: "Rumors of dissent spread through the ranks, fueled by defeat and hardship. Agitators preach treachery, urging soldiers to lay down their arms.\n\nEvery day discipline weakens, and the army edges closer to collapse. The leadership must decide — crush the rot or ignore it at their peril."

  soviet_agitation.2.d: "From the factories to the front, anarchists whisper promises of peace. Slogans scrawled on walls and shouted in streets poison morale.\n\nThe message is simple: end the war. If left unchecked, their influence could tear the nation apart."

  soviet_agitation.3.d: "A remote outpost reports a deadly attack by insurgents. Isolated and outnumbered, the garrison fell before reinforcements could arrive.\n\nThe incident is a chilling sign — unrest now fuels open violence. When it comes to this, it might mean it is too late to act."

  # alexei
  soviet_alexei.1.d: "For years, Tsarevich Alexei's illness cast a shadow over the Romanov dynasty. The court physicians had given up hope — until a wandering mystic arrived in St. Petersburg.\n\nWithin days of his presence, the boy’s bleeding ceased. The Tsar and Tsarina are overwhelmed with gratitude. The imperial court is stunned. Whispers speak of divine intervention — or dangerous superstition."

  soviet_alexei.2.d: "News of the Tsarevich’s recovery has swept through the empire. For some, it is a miracle — proof of God's favor upon the House of Romanov. Others remain skeptical, warning that such 'signs' are the tools of charlatans.\n\nNevertheless, in churches and barracks alike, faith in the monarchy flickers brighter today."

  # central asia
  soviet_central_asia.1.d: "Reports indicate an increase in Turanist propaganda circulating throughout Central Asia. Ottoman agents and sympathizers have been actively promoting pan-Turkic unity, seeking to stir nationalist sentiments among the diverse peoples of the region.\n\nThe movement’s true strength remains uncertain, but its potential to destabilize the imperial order cannot be ignored."

  soviet_central_asia.2.d: "Several Ottoman agents were uncovered attempting to coordinate with local Turanist groups. Their activities include distributing propaganda and fomenting unrest aimed at undermining imperial control.\n\nThe government must respond decisively if it hopes to quell these subversive efforts and maintain stability in this vital region."

  # civil war
  soviet_civil_war.1.d: "In [195.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], barricades rise and red banners fly. Armed workers have stormed key government buildings, claiming the revolution has begun.\n\nThe city is paralyzed as the old order reels from the shock. Across the empire, whispers of revolt now thunder like drums."

  soviet_civil_war.2.d: "Rumors swirl through foreign newspapers: the Tsar and his family, executed by firing squad in a basement. There are no photos, only a bloodstained silence and denials from Moscow.\n\nFor some, it is justice long overdue. For others, it is the final severing of Russia from its past."

  soviet_civil_war.3.d: "From the ashes of imperial collapse, Poland declares its rebirth. In Warsaw, crowds cheer as soldiers raise a new flag over the city.\n\nThe republic proclaims liberty, independence, and a new future. But nearby, old powers stir, unwilling to let go."

  soviet_civil_war.4.d: "Kyiv falls not to foreign invaders, but to native sons proclaiming a free Ukraine. The black and gold of imperial rule is torn down, replaced with blue and yellow.\n\nNationalists, peasants, and veterans now fight under one banner. The long dream of independence breathes again."

  soviet_civil_war.5.d: "Across the Baltics, German rifles crack in defiance of Russian rule. Former settlers, nobles, and officers unite beneath their ancient banners.\n\nThey call for autonomy, dignity, and the end of Bolshevik chaos. A new front opens in the crumbling empire."

  # greece
  soviet_greece.1.d: "In a move fraught with both opportunity and risk, [SOV.GetNameDef] has extended an offer of mutual guarantees to our government. The proposal pledges to defend Greek sovereignty in the face of foreign aggression — and expects the same in return.\n\nSome see this as a long-overdue alignment with our Orthodox protector. Others warn it could entangle Greece in the rivalries of great powers once more."

  soviet_greece.2.d: "[SOV.GetName] and Greece have formally exchanged mutual guarantees. The agreement, though limited in scope, signals a growing alignment between Athens and St. Petersburg.\n\nWhile some European observers dismiss it as symbolic, others fear it marks the opening of a new phase in the contest for influence in south-east Europe."

  soviet_greece.3.d: "Serbia has declined [SOV.GetNameDef]’s offer of mutual guarantees. The decision, made quietly but firmly, comes amid fears of entrapment in wider imperial schemes.\n\nRussian officials have issued no formal protest — but behind closed doors, disappointment is palpable. In the imperial court, the Balkans remain as vexing as ever."

  # ukraine
  soviet_ukraine.1.d: "Even modest democratic reforms in the capital have sent tremors through the southwestern provinces. In Ukraine, long-standing grievances over land, language, and autonomy are surfacing with renewed force.\n\nProtests in Kyiv and Odesa have remained mostly peaceful, but the countryside is increasingly restless. Some call for federalism. Others for independence. All demand to be heard."
  
  soviet_ukraine.2.d: "In a rare moment of unity, Ukrainian moderates and democratic delegates have co-signed a proposal calling for sweeping agrarian reform. The goal: to defuse rural unrest and bring the region into peaceful alignment with the reformist movement.\n\nWhile some conservatives grumble, the proposal has been well received by local communities and democratic newspapers alike."
  
  soviet_ukraine.3.d: "The fragile calm has broken. Several granaries in Mykolaiv have been torched overnight, and railway sabotage is on the rise across southern Ukraine. The perpetrators remain unknown, but their message is clear: discontent is now open revolt.\n\nThe government must now decide whether to pacify the countryside through concessions — or stamp out the unrest with force."

  soviet_ukraine.4.d: "Following direct negotiations with rural leaders, tensions in Ukraine have eased. Promises of land redistribution and regional recognition have been met with cautious optimism. Peasant assemblies in several oblasts have even called for calm.\n\nIt is a fragile peace, but peace nonetheless."
  
  soviet_ukraine.5.d: "The crackdown has backfired. Reports describe chaos across the Ukrainian steppe: armed uprisings, mutinous soldiers, and mass desertions. Kyiv teeters on the edge, while black banners fly openly in the south.\n\nRevolutionary elements now claim leadership of the insurrection. The region slips further from the government's grasp by the hour."
  
  soviet_ukraine.6.d: "After weeks of brutal fighting and political maneuvering, the government has reasserted control over Ukraine. Streets are quiet again, but many whisper of repression, arrests, and the silent return of exiled tzarist officers.\n\nFor now, order has returned. But few believe it will last."
