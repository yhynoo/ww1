 greek_question.0.d: "With growing unrest in Greek-populated territories, the government of [TUR.GetNameDef] is debating whether to grant local autonomy in an attempt to pacify nationalist demands. Some officials argue that limited self-rule could preserve Turkish influence while reducing tensions, while others see any concession as a dangerous precedent that could embolden separatists across the empire.\n\nAs debate rages in Constantinople, Greek leaders cautiously await the decision. Will this be a turning point in Ottoman-Greek relations, or is conflict inevitable?"

 greek_question.1.d: "In a surprising shift, [TUR.GetNameDef] has granted Greek authorities administrative control over some territories, including Crete and the Aegean Islands. The move is seen as an effort to de-escalate tensions while maintaining imperial sovereignty over the region.\n\nWhile some celebrate this as a step toward reconciliation, others fear it could be the first step toward full Greek independence. Will this limited autonomy satisfy Greek ambitions, or is this just the beginning of a greater struggle?"

 greek_question.2.d: "In a dramatic turn, the [TUR.GetNameDef] has transferred administrative control of mainland Greece to Greek authorities, a move that drastically alters the balance of power in the region. The decision follows years of unrest and pressure from nationalist movements, as well as the growing international scrutiny of Ottoman rule.\n\nWith the Greek administration now in charge of its historic heartland, questions arise about what comes next. Will this be the foundation of a stable Turkish-Greek arrangement, or the first step toward total independence?"

 greek_question.3.d: "The Ottoman Empire has approached France with a bold proposal—take custody over Greece in exchange for political and military guarantees. With nationalist movements threatening Ottoman control, some in Constantinople see French oversight as a way to prevent further instability while securing strategic assurances.\n\nHowever, accepting such an offer could entangle France in Balkan affairs and provoke reactions from other European powers. Will Paris accept the responsibility, or will Greece’s fate remain uncertain?"

 greek_question.4.d: "In a stunning diplomatic agreement, [FRA.GetName] has assumed custody over [GRE.GetName], taking on responsibility for governance and security in the region. The move, negotiated with [TUR.GetNameDef], is seen as an effort to stabilize Greece while maintaining Ottoman-French cooperation.\n\nWhile some hail this as a pragmatic solution, others see it as imperial interference. Will French stewardship bring peace, or has Greece simply traded one overlord for another?"

 greek_question.5.d: "The French government has officially rejected the Turkish proposal to assume custody over Greece, leaving Constantinople with few options to handle the growing unrest. Many in the empire had hoped that a French guarantee would stabilize the region, but with Paris unwilling to intervene, the situation remains volatile.\n\nWithout external backing, the Turkish authorities must now decide whether to impose direct rule once more—or brace for the possibility of open rebellion. Is Greece on the brink of crisis?"

 greek_question.7.d: "The Greek government has officially requested control over Cyprus, citing historical, cultural, and strategic reasons for the island’s integration into Greece. The proposal has been submitted to the current administration, and discussions are now underway.\n\nSome Greek officials argue that securing Cyprus would strengthen national security, while others warn that such a request might provoke diplomatic tensions. Will this move succeed, or will Greece be denied once more?"

 greek_question.8.d: "After diplomatic negotiations, Cyprus has officially been transferred to Greek administration, fulfilling a long-standing nationalist ambition. Celebrations erupt in Athens as officials declare the island an inseparable part of Greece.\n\nWhile many see this as a peaceful resolution to a decades-old issue, others worry about the broader implications. Will this embolden further Greek territorial ambitions, or does this mark the end of such disputes?"

 greek_question.9.d: "Despite Athens’ formal request, the governing administration has refused to hand over Cyprus to Greek control. The decision has sparked outrage among Greek nationalists, who see it as another betrayal of their aspirations.\n\nFor now, Cyprus remains outside Greek sovereignty, but this refusal may only inflame tensions further. Will Athens accept the decision, or is this only the beginning of a larger diplomatic struggle?"
