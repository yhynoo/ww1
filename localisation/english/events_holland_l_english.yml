  # Army Mutinies
  holland_antidemocratic_movements.1.d:0 "In the wake of the deep government crisis following the unsanctioned intervention in Flanders, elements within the Dutch army have begun expressing anti-democratic sentiments. Officers who would rather see the government entirely dissolved are gaining influence, and whispers of restoring royal authority grow louder.\n\nThe government must act decisively before these factions destabilize the state any further."

  holland_antidemocratic_movements.2.d:0 "The Dutch army has issued an ultimatum to The Hague: dissolve the democratic government and restore royal leadership under Queen Wilhelmina, or face the consequences. While support for monarchy has grown, resistance remains strong within both civilian and military ranks, and the Queen herself has so far avoided fueling the tensions.\n\nThe choice may plunge the country into chaos — or usher in a new order."

  holland_antidemocratic_movements.3.d:0 "In a stunning development, the Dutch democratic government has been dissolved. Queen Wilhelmina has assumed direct control of the state, with the military's backing. The move is controversial but has so far avoided a civil conflict.\n\nThe monarchy now leads the Netherlands into uncertain waters."

  holland_antidemocratic_movements.4.d:0 "As the government refused to yield to military pressure and Queen Wilhelmina soundly supported the democratic order, anti-democratic elements within the Dutch army have risen in rebellion. Armed clashes have broken out across the country, marking the beginning of a civil war between authoritarianists and democrats.\n\nThe Netherlands is engulfed in internal conflict."

  # Belgian Crisis
  holland_belgian_crisis.1.d:0 "The Dutch government has approached us with an urgent request: to intervene in Flanders and assume direct administration of the region. Trying to deal with the fallout of their unauthorized military intervention, they argue this is the only way to restore order.\n\nWhile this move is anticipated by the international community, it will put a strain on our administration."

  holland_belgian_crisis.2.d:0 "France has accepted the Dutch proposal and taken over control of Flanders. French troops are being deployed, and administration is being handed over.\n\nA sigh of relief can be heard in The Hague and Brussels alike, with many expecting the Belgian sovereignty restored in the near future."

  holland_belgian_crisis.3.d:0 "Despite Dutch pressure, France has declined to take action in Flanders. As unrest grows and administrative paralysis sets in, the Dutch face criticism both domestically and abroad for their lack of control of their own military."

  holland_belgian_crisis.4.d:0 "With the recent Dutch refusal to hand Flanders over to France, voices within our government urge a break from neutrality. By securing guarantees or finding stronger allies, we could maintain control of Flanders in a long-term perspective.\n\nIt’s time to decide our course: diplomacy, alliance, or continued neutrality?"

  holland_belgian_crisis.5.d:0 "The Netherlands has approached us seeking guarantees for its sovereignty and continued control of Flanders. \n\nArguing about French ineptitude, the Dutch are sending a strong signal about a shift in the balance of power on the continent."

  holland_belgian_crisis.6.d:0 "[ENG.GetName] has agreed to guarantee the Netherlands' position. Their support lends legitimacy to Dutch authority in Flanders and may deter aggression from others in the region.\n\nEverybody agrees that the situation in Western Europe has now changed dramatically."

  holland_belgian_crisis.7.d:0 "[ENG.GetName] has declined to guarantee the Netherlands' position in Flanders, signalling lack of acceptance for Dutch attempts to change the political order in Western Europe.\n\nThis decision weakens Dutch diplomatic standing and may embolden rivals to act."

  holland_belgian_crisis.8.d:0 "The Dutch government has reached out to Berlin with an offer of alliance.\n\nExpecting hostility from [FRA.GetName] and [ENG.GetName] over their decision to remain in Flanders, they believe cooperation with Germany is the only logical path forward."

  holland_belgian_crisis.9.d:0 "Germany has accepted the Dutch proposal for alliance.\n\nThe two nations have formalized their relationship, with the Netherlands abandoning its long-standing neutrality in the face of continental upheaval."

  holland_belgian_crisis.10.d:0 "Germany has rejected the Dutch offer of alliance.\n\nWithout support from Berlin, the Netherlands remains isolated in its stance regarding Flanders and must consider alternative strategies."
