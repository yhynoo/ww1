  # Aftermath in Flanders

  holland_aftermath_in_flanders.1.d: "Following the collapse of the Belgian government and France’s hesitant reaction during the crisis, the Dutch general Jo van Heutsz led his troops into Wallonia and Flanders, citing the need to restore order and prevent German incursions.\n\nNow, with the region under provisional Dutch administration and pressure mounting from both local populations and foreign observers, [HOL.GetName] has formally requested that France take over civil and military authority. For Paris, this is both a test of legitimacy and an opportunity to correct past inaction."

  holland_aftermath_in_flanders.2.d: "French troops have crossed into Flanders, relieving Dutch forces and taking control of the area. While many see this as a delayed but welcome move, others view it as France simply cleaning up the mess left by earlier hesitation during the Belgian Crisis.\n\nNevertheless, the move is likely to calm the situation—at least temporarily—as the region transitions to direct French administration."

  holland_aftermath_in_flanders.3.d: "Once again, France has chosen not to act decisively. Despite repeated requests from Dutch command and increasing instability in the former Belgian territories, the French government has declined to intervene.\n\nDutch troops remain in Flanders under growing strain, and the legitimacy of their continued presence is increasingly questioned. The specter of German expansionism only adds to the sense of urgency now hanging over the region."

  # Dutch World Trade Hegemony

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.1.d: "Following a series of investments in Cape Town and mounting interest in the broader African continent, [HOL.GetName] has issued a statement of support for the Boer communities in southern Africa. Citing cultural ties and shared language, Dutch officials have condemned British treatment of Boer populations in recent years.\n\nWhile no formal action has been taken, the move has sparked concern in London and drawn attention across Europe. Could this signal renewed tensions in the region—or even another Boer War?"

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.2.d: "Representatives of the Royal Dutch Shell have arrived in our capital, demanding full access to oil drilling rights in the southern fields. Backed by [HOL.GetAdjective] commercial interests and diplomatic weight, the proposal is framed as part of a broader investment and infrastructure package.\n\nWhile cooperation could bring much-needed development, many warn that accepting such a deal would grant the Dutch undue influence over our national resources. Refusal, however, may not come without consequences."

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.3.d: "Dutch commercial activity in the Persian Gulf is rapidly expanding. With Royal Dutch Shell establishing refineries and transport infrastructure, the Netherlands appears to be positioning itself as a dominant trade and energy power in the region.\n\nThis quiet expansion has drawn both admiration and unease among global observers, as the balance of power in the oil trade begins to shift."

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.4.d: "[PER.GetName] has firmly rejected Dutch overtures, denying Shell the drilling rights they sought in Persian territory. While the decision was hailed by Persian nationalists, it has caused alarm in Amsterdam and raised the specter of retaliation.\n\nThe Netherlands now faces a choice—respect the decision or escalate the situation, possibly through force. The future of Dutch-Persian relations hangs in the balance."

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.5.d: "In a bold diplomatic maneuver, [HOL.GetName] has approached our government with an offer: full erasure of significant debts in exchange for the Suez Canal zone. The proposal is as enticing as it is controversial. By transferring control of this vital trade artery to the Dutch, we would gain immediate financial relief—but at the cost of long-term strategic leverage.\n\nWhile some advisors view this as a lifeline, others warn that such a move will enrage the British and irreversibly alter the balance of influence in the Eastern Mediterranean."

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.6.d: "[HOL.GetName] has assumed full control over the Suez Canal and its surrounding territory following a historic agreement with the Turkish government. In return, significant Turkish foreign debt has been erased—an offer too tempting to refuse.\n\nThe reaction across Europe has been swift and sharp. In London, outrage dominates political discourse, with many demanding action to reverse what is seen as a direct challenge to British maritime supremacy."

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.7.d: "The Turkish government has rejected The Hague's offers to exchange the Suez Canal zone for debt forgiveness. The refusal, seen by some as a principled stand for sovereignty, has raised eyebrows among foreign creditors who viewed the deal as an elegant solution to mounting liabilities.\n\nFor now, the status quo holds—but speculation swirls as to how long it can last."

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.8.d: "Following the surprise transfer of the Suez Canal to Dutch hands, a growing chorus within the British establishment demands retaliation. Some argue that allowing this new reality to stand would undermine British economic interests and global prestige.\n\nParliament now debates whether to issue formal opposition—or take more drastic measures."

  holland_world_trade_hegemony.9.d: "The British government has formally condemned our acquisition of the Suez Canal zone, declaring it a threat to regional stability and British maritime dominance. British claims have been placed on the territory, and there are whispers of mobilization.\n\n[HOL.GetName] must now decide how to navigate this confrontation, as the age of trade wars and colonial entanglements deepens."

  # Wilhelmina

  holland_prinsgezindheid.1.d: "Without warning, Dutch soldiers surrounded the Binnenhof and ordered the members of Parliament to disband. Under the direct command of General Jo van Heutsz, the army has declared the legislative body dissolved and handed full authority to Queen Wilhelmina.\n\nThe general appeared briefly on national radio, stating that \"the time for indecision is over\" and that \"Her Majesty will now guide the nation without obstruction.\" No legal justification was provided, and no further announcements have been made. Overnight, the Netherlands has transformed into a monarchy in absolute form."

  # Troelstra

  l_english:

  holland_troelstra.1.d: "Pieter Jelles Troelstra, the veteran socialist leader, has declared a revolutionary government in Rotterdam. Backed by radicalized workers and elements of the navy, his forces seized key infrastructure across the city before dawn. In a fiery proclamation, he denounced the influence of van Heutsz, calling on the people to rise against \"a regime of oppression and war.\"\n\nStreet battles have erupted between loyalist troops and the red militias, with reports of barricades going up in other industrial centers. The Netherlands, torn between monarchy and revolution, is now plunged into civil war."
