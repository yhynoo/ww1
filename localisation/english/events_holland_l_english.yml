  # Aftermath in Flanders
  holland_aftermath_in_flanders.1.d: "Following the collapse of the Belgian government and France’s hesitant reaction during the crisis, the Dutch general Jo van Heutsz led his troops into Wallonia and Flanders, citing the need to restore order and prevent German incursions.\n\nNow, with the region under provisional Dutch administration and pressure mounting from both local populations and foreign observers, [HOL.GetName] has formally requested that France take over civil and military authority. For Paris, this is both a test of legitimacy and an opportunity to correct past inaction."
  holland_aftermath_in_flanders.2.d: "French troops have crossed into Flanders, relieving Dutch forces and taking control of the area. While many see this as a delayed but welcome move, others view it as France simply cleaning up the mess left by earlier hesitation during the Belgian Crisis.\n\nNevertheless, the move is likely to calm the situation—at least temporarily—as the region transitions to direct French administration."
  holland_aftermath_in_flanders.3.d: "Once again, France has chosen not to act decisively. Despite repeated requests from Dutch command and increasing instability in the former Belgian territories, the French government has declined to intervene.\n\nDutch troops remain in Flanders under growing strain, and the legitimacy of their continued presence is increasingly questioned. The specter of German expansionism only adds to the sense of urgency now hanging over the region."

  # Alliances
  holland_england.1.d: "With tensions escalating across the continent, [FROM.GetNameDef] has approached [ROOT.GetNameDef] with a formal request to join the Entente.\n\nCaught between the ambitions of France and the growing assertiveness of Germany, Dutch leaders believe their historic neutrality is no longer a viable shield. Instead, they seek the security of alliance with Britain — a maritime power long seen as the ultimate guarantor of Western European independence."
  holland_england.2.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has welcomed [FROM.GetNameDef] into the Entente. The move formalizes a new chapter in Anglo-Dutch cooperation, transforming centuries of maritime rivalry and cautious diplomacy into a shared strategic vision.\n\nObservers across Europe are watching closely, as Amsterdam — long seen as a neutral buffer — becomes active players in the continent's unfolding alignment."
  holland_england.3.d: "While reluctant to fully abandon its traditional neutrality, [FROM.GetNameDef] has proposed a mutual guarantee pact as a compromise. This arrangement would provide for coordinated defense in the event of foreign aggression, without binding either nation to broader military obligations."
  holland_england.4.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] and [ROOT.GetNameDef] have signed a mutual defense treaty. Though not a formal alliance, the pact ensures that any violation of Dutch or British sovereignty will be met with coordinated military response.\n\nFor many, it marks the quiet end of Dutch neutrality and a deepening of Britain's continental commitments."
  holland_england.5.d: "Talks between [FROM.GetNameDef] and [ROOT.GetNameDef] have broken down. Despite shared anxieties over continental militarism, the two sides were unable to agree on terms for mutual security.\n\nThe failure leaves [FROM.GetNameDef] exposed and increases the likelihood that the Netherlands will face future crises alone."
  holland_england.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has declined [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s request for a formal alliance. Though diplomatic relations remain cordial, London has made it clear that it will not be drawn into additional commitments on the continent — at least for now."

  holland_germany.1.d: "In a bold diplomatic move, [FROM.GetNameDef] has proposed a formal alliance with [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nCiting rising French assertiveness and growing concerns over the future of the Low Countries, Dutch officials frame the offer as a natural convergence of interests. They emphasize shared cultural ties, continental security, and mutual outrage over the fate of the Boers in South Africa — whom many in the Netherlands still view as kin."
  holland_germany.2.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has accepted the Dutch proposal for alliance, marking a historic turn in the balance of European diplomacy.\n\nFor decades, [FROM.GetAdjective] neutrality kept it on the sidelines of great power politics. But growing Franco-British influence — and sympathy with the embattled Afrikaner cause — have drawn the Netherlands into the orbit of the Central Powers."
  holland_germany.3.d: "While declining to commit to a full military alliance, [FROM.GetNameDef] has instead proposed a system of mutual guarantees. The arrangement would ensure coordinated defensive action in the event of foreign aggression, while preserving each nation’s strategic autonomy."
  holland_germany.4.d: "A mutual defense agreement has been concluded between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef]. Though not as sweeping as a formal alliance, the agreement solidifies a shared front against potential French or British intervention and affirms deepening strategic trust between Berlin and The Hague."
  holland_germany.5.d: "Negotiations between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef] have collapsed. Despite shared suspicion of France and historical common ground, political caution and internal divisions have led the Dutch government to walk away from closer alignment with Berlin."
  holland_germany.6.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has declined the Dutch offer of alliance.\n\nWhether due to diplomatic caution or strategic doubts, Berlin has opted not to bind itself to The Hague — at least for now. The rejection leaves the Netherlands in an uncertain position, still vulnerable to the shifting winds of European power."

  holland_usa.1.d: "In a remarkable overture, [FROM.GetNameDef] has requested to join the growing coalition of democratic states led by [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nFraming their appeal in the language of liberty, international law, and self-determination, Dutch diplomats invoke the spirit of Woodrow Wilson’s call for a world made safe for democracy. With rising authoritarianism in Europe, The Hague appears eager to align itself with the moral leadership of the United States."
  holland_usa.2.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has formally welcomed [FROM.GetNameDef] into its alliance. Though separated by an ocean, the two democracies are now bound together in a common cause — to defend liberty and uphold a new rules-based international order.\n\nObservers see this as the clearest sign yet of America's growing commitment to shaping global affairs."
  holland_usa.3.d: "While stopping short of a full alliance, [FROM.GetNameDef] has offered a reciprocal guarantee of defense. The agreement would serve as a deterrent to aggressors while preserving each nation’s flexibility and sovereign decision-making."
  holland_usa.4.d: "A mutual defense pact has been signed between [FROM.GetNameDef] and [ROOT.GetNameDef], representing a significant step in transatlantic cooperation.\n\nThough not a formal alliance, the agreement symbolizes shared democratic values and a common interest in deterring authoritarian aggression."
  holland_usa.5.d: "Talks between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef] have failed to produce any agreement. Despite shared democratic principles, the political distance and military imbalance between the two nations proved difficult to bridge."
  holland_usa.6.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has declined [FROM.GetAdjective] efforts to join the Anti-Colonialist Union. Whether due to strategic caution or concerns over entanglement, Washington has opted not to extend formal commitments to The Hague — at least for now."

  # Dutch World Trade Hegemony
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.1.d: "Following a series of investments in Cape Town and mounting interest in the broader African continent, [HOL.GetName] has issued a statement of support for the Boer communities in southern Africa. Citing cultural ties and shared language, Dutch officials have condemned British treatment of Boer populations in recent years.\n\nWhile no formal action has been taken, the move has sparked concern in London and drawn attention across Europe. Could this signal renewed tensions in the region—or even another Boer War?"
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.2.d: "Representatives of the Royal Dutch Shell have arrived in our capital, demanding full access to oil drilling rights in the southern fields. Backed by [HOL.GetAdjective] commercial interests and diplomatic weight, the proposal is framed as part of a broader investment and infrastructure package.\n\nWhile cooperation could bring much-needed development, many warn that accepting such a deal would grant the Dutch undue influence over our national resources. Refusal, however, may not come without consequences."
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.3.d: "Dutch commercial activity in the Persian Gulf is rapidly expanding. With Royal Dutch Shell establishing refineries and transport infrastructure, the Netherlands appears to be positioning itself as a dominant trade and energy power in the region.\n\nThis quiet expansion has drawn both admiration and unease among global observers, as the balance of power in the oil trade begins to shift."
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.4.d: "[PER.GetName] has firmly rejected Dutch overtures, denying Shell the drilling rights they sought in Persian territory. While the decision was hailed by Persian nationalists, it has caused alarm in Amsterdam and raised the specter of retaliation.\n\nThe Netherlands now faces a choice—respect the decision or escalate the situation, possibly through force. The future of Dutch-Persian relations hangs in the balance."
  
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.5.d: "In a bold diplomatic maneuver, [HOL.GetName] has approached our government with an offer: full erasure of significant debts in exchange for the Suez Canal zone. The proposal is as enticing as it is controversial. By transferring control of this vital trade artery to the Dutch, we would gain immediate financial relief—but at the cost of long-term strategic leverage.\n\nWhile some advisors view this as a lifeline, others warn that such a move will enrage the British and irreversibly alter the balance of influence in the Eastern Mediterranean."
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.6.d: "[HOL.GetName] has assumed full control over the Suez Canal and its surrounding territory following a historic agreement with the Turkish government. In return, significant Turkish foreign debt has been erased—an offer too tempting to refuse.\n\nThe reaction across Europe has been swift and sharp. In London, outrage dominates political discourse, with many demanding action to reverse what is seen as a direct challenge to British maritime supremacy."
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.7.d: "The Turkish government has rejected The Hague's offers to exchange the Suez Canal zone for debt forgiveness. The refusal, seen by some as a principled stand for sovereignty, has raised eyebrows among foreign creditors who viewed the deal as an elegant solution to mounting liabilities.\n\nFor now, the status quo holds—but speculation swirls as to how long it can last."
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.8.d: "Following the surprise transfer of the Suez Canal to Dutch hands, a growing chorus within the British establishment demands retaliation. Some argue that allowing this new reality to stand would undermine British economic interests and global prestige.\n\nParliament now debates whether to issue formal opposition—or take more drastic measures."
  holland_world_trade_hegemony.9.d: "The British government has formally condemned our acquisition of the Suez Canal zone, declaring it a threat to regional stability and British maritime dominance. British claims have been placed on the territory, and there are whispers of mobilization.\n\n[HOL.GetName] must now decide how to navigate this confrontation, as the age of trade wars and colonial entanglements deepens."

  # Wilhelmina
  holland_prinsgezindheid.1.d: "Without warning, Dutch soldiers surrounded the Binnenhof and ordered the members of Parliament to disband. Under the direct command of General Jo van Heutsz, the army has declared the legislative body dissolved and handed full authority to Queen Wilhelmina.\n\nThe general appeared briefly on national radio, stating that \"the time for indecision is over\" and that \"Her Majesty will now guide the nation without obstruction.\" No legal justification was provided, and no further announcements have been made. Overnight, the Netherlands has transformed into a monarchy in absolute form."

  # Troelstra
  holland_troelstra.1.d: "Pieter Jelles Troelstra, the veteran socialist leader, has declared a revolutionary government in Rotterdam. Backed by radicalized workers and elements of the navy, his forces seized key infrastructure across the city before dawn. In a fiery proclamation, he denounced the influence of van Heutsz, calling on the people to rise against \"a regime of oppression and war.\"\n\nStreet battles have erupted between loyalist troops and the red militias, with reports of barricades going up in other industrial centers. The Netherlands, torn between monarchy and revolution, is now plunged into civil war."
