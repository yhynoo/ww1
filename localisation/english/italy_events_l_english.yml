  # aegean
  italy_aegean.1.d: "Citing historical claims and growing naval interests in the Eastern Mediterranean, Italy has formally demanded that [TUR.GetNameDef] cede the Aegean Islands to Italian administration.\n\nRome argues that these territories are poorly defended and would be better managed under Italian stewardship — a veiled ultimatum backed by the threat of military escalation."

  italy_aegean.2.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has conceded to Italy’s demands and transferred control of the Aegean Islands. Italian forces have begun to establish their presence across the archipelago, securing key ports and administrative centers.\n\nWhile Rome celebrates this strategic acquisition, the move has unsettled other regional powers, wary of Italy’s expanding influence in the Mediterranean."

  italy_aegean.3.d: "The Turkish government has refused Italy’s demands regarding the Aegean Islands, denouncing the move as a blatant act of aggression and territorial theft.\n\nWith diplomatic channels exhausted, tensions between Rome and Constantinople are rapidly escalating — and a confrontation now appears inevitable."

  # libya

  italy_libya.1.d: "Italy has issued a bold demand to [TUR.GetNameDef]: the complete transfer of Libya into Italian hands.\n\nFraming the request as a move to bring civilization and stability to a neglected province, Rome’s true intentions are clear — the expansion of its colonial empire in North Africa, and a strategic challenge to Ottoman authority in the Mediterranean."

  italy_libya.2.d: "In a significant concession, the Ottoman government has handed over Libya to Italian administration. Italian troops have entered the region and begun organizing its governance, marking another step in Italy’s colonial expansion.\n\nWhile Rome claims this as a triumph of diplomacy, the transfer is being met with unrest across the newly occupied territory."

  italy_libya.3.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has rejected Italy’s demand to relinquish Libya. Citing sovereignty and national pride, Constantinople has drawn a clear line, refusing to be coerced into giving up its North African territory.\n\nRome now faces a decision: escalate to war, or retreat in humiliation."

  # tirol

  italy_tirol.1.d: "The Italian government has formally approached us, requesting diplomatic backing in their long-standing claim to South Tirol — currently under Austro-Hungarian control.\n\nRome argues that with our support, they can peacefully secure this territory, historically and culturally aligned with Italy. The question is whether we should intervene on their behalf, potentially upsetting the balance of power in Central Europe."

  italy_tirol.2.d: "After brief consideration, the British government has declined to involve itself in the dispute between Italy and Austria-Hungary.\n\nRome's appeals for support have been rebuffed, leaving Italy to face Vienna without the benefit of external pressure."

  italy_tirol.3.d: "The British have come forward to support Italy’s claim to South Tirol, delivering a stern message to Vienna.\n\nThis diplomatic intervention has placed immense pressure on us to concede. We must now decide between appeasement or defiance."

  italy_tirol.4.d: "In a significant geopolitical shift, [AUS.GetNameDef] has ceded South Tirol to Italy under pressure from the United Kingdom.\n\nRome celebrates the transfer as a triumph of diplomacy, while Vienna seethes over what many see as a humiliating concession."

  italy_tirol.5.d: "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has rejected the diplomatic push by the British and refused to surrender South Tirol to Italy.\n\nTensions are escalating, and Italy now weighs the possibility of war to assert its claim."
