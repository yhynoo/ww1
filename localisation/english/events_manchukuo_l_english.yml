  # The Opium Crisis
  manchukuo_the_opium_crisis.1.d:0 "With the opium crisis destabilizing the region, some within [MAN.GetName] believe that seeking British support could strengthen their position. The English, with their interests in Asia, may be willing to back an effort to assert control over Indochina.\n\nShould we reach out to them, or handle this matter alone?"

  manchukuo_the_opium_crisis.2.d:0 "[MAN.GetName] has approached our government, requesting support in resolving the opium crisis and securing control over parts of Indochina. They argue that a cooperative effort could stabilize the region and serve our mutual interests.\n\nShould we consider this opportunity, or ignore their request?"

  manchukuo_the_opium_crisis.3.d:0 "[ENG.GetName] has chosen to ignore our request for support, leaving us to handle the crisis alone. While disappointing, this does not mean the end of our ambitions in Indochina.\n\nWe must decide whether to proceed with our demands regardless or abandon the effort for now."

  manchukuo_the_opium_crisis.4.d:0 "A diplomatic shock has arrived—[MAN.GetName] has formally demanded control over parts of Indochina! Claiming the region is poorly managed and fueling the opium crisis, they insist that transferring ownership is the only path to stability.\n\nWe must decide whether to comply or stand our ground."

  manchukuo_the_opium_crisis.5.d:0 "A joint ultimatum has been issued by [MAN.GetName] and [ENG.GetName], demanding the immediate handover of Indochina. They argue that colonial mismanagement has worsened the opium crisis, and only their leadership can bring order to the region.\n\nWe now face a difficult choice—yield to their demands or prepare for conflict."

  manchukuo_the_opium_crisis.6.d:0 "[ROOT.GetName] has formally withdrawn from Indochina, ceding control to new authorities. This dramatic shift signals the end of their colonial administration in the region, bringing both uncertainty and opportunity for those who now rule over these lands."

  manchukuo_the_opium_crisis.7.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has outright rejected our demands for Indochina. Their refusal leaves us with little choice—if we wish to secure our claims, we must be prepared to fight for them.\n\nTensions rise, and war seems inevitable."

  manchukuo_the_opium_crisis.8.d:0 "With the colonial powers withdrawing from Indochina, the opium crisis that once destabilized the region has largely subsided. While challenges remain, the worst of the crisis is now behind us, bringing a long-awaited sense of relief."

  ## Another Great Campaign
  manchukuo_another_great_campaign.1.d:0 "Claiming historical and strategic necessity, [MAN.GetName] has formally demanded the transfer of Korea from [JAP.GetName]. They argue that Japanese rule has outlived its purpose and that Korea should now be integrated into their expanding domain.\n\n[MAN.GetName] awaits our response—will we comply or refuse?"

  manchukuo_another_great_campaign.2.d:0 "In a surprising move, [JAP.GetName] has agreed to cede Korea to [MAN.GetName], bringing an abrupt end to their rule in the peninsula.\n\nWhile this avoids immediate conflict, the long-term implications of this power shift remain uncertain."

  manchukuo_another_great_campaign.3.d:0 "[JAP.GetName] has refused to surrender control of Korea, outright rejecting [MAN.GetName]'s demands. With neither side willing to back down, tensions rise, and the possibility of war looms over East Asia."

  ## Modernization
  manchukuo_modernization.1.d:0 "[MAN.GetName] has proposed a joint industrial and infrastructure initiative, inviting us to collaborate on a major railway enterprise. They argue that such a partnership would strengthen economic ties and modernize key transport routes.\n\nShould we accept their offer or decline this venture?"

  manchukuo_modernization.2.d:0 "[MAN.GetName] has officially announced the creation of a joint railway enterprise with American investors, marking a significant step in modernizing their infrastructure. This ambitious project aims to enhance trade and transportation, bringing new opportunities to the region."

  manchukuo_modernization.3.d:0 "[USA.GetName] has declined [MAN.GetName]’s offer to collaborate on a railway project, citing concerns over financial risks and strategic priorities. With American investment off the table, [MAN.GetName] must seek alternative ways to modernize its infrastructure."
