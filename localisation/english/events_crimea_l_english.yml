  # Civil war
  crimea_civil_war.1.d: "With central authority crumbling and the fires of civil war spreading across the empire, the Caucasus has erupted in revolt. From the mountain valleys of Dagestan to the shores of the Black Sea, armed resistance has surged against Russian rule.\n\nLocal militias, former Ottoman subjects, and Crimean Tatars have formed a fragile alliance, declaring their independence from the chaos engulfing the Russian heartland. Driven by memories of imperial repression and the promise of self-determination, they now prepare to defend their homeland from the forces of the collapsing state they once served."
