From the mountain valleys of Dagestan to the shores of the Black Sea, armed resistance has surged against Russian rule.\n\nLocal militias, former Ottoman subjects, and Crimean Tatars have formed a fragile alliance, declaring their independence from the chaos engulfing the Russian heartland.

The call of the ummah is clear."

The new administration has pledged loyalty to the Sublime Porte and committed itself to defending the region’s independence, Islamic values, and its role in the fight against [SOV.GetNameDef]. A new chapter begins in the South Caucasus."
