  # dock strike chain
  england_dockers.1.d: "In the wake of sweeping reforms and the abolition of the House of Lords, industrial unrest has surged. Dockworkers across southern England have gone on strike, demanding fairer wages, shorter hours, and formal recognition of their unions.\n\nSome in government see this as a chance to entrench popular support. Others warn of emboldening the radical left."

  england_dockers.2.d: "After tense negotiations, union leaders have agreed to return to work. While the settlement falls short of full demands, it secures modest wage increases and limited labor protections.\n\nReformers hail it as pragmatic progress. Conservatives grumble about setting a precedent."

  england_dockers.3.d: "Government inaction has fanned the flames. Across southern ports, strikes have intensified — and now radical pamphlets circulate openly, urging workers to seize the means of production.\n\nOpposition leaders decry the government’s cowardice. Inside Parliament, murmurs of 'Bolshevism on the Solent' grow louder."

  england_dockers.4.d: "Following a sharp escalation in Portsmouth and Southampton, government envoys have struck a hasty deal with regional union councils. Full recognition of workers' committees and sweeping concessions have brought a temporary calm.\n\nBut many now ask: was this labor politics — or the beginning of dual power in the south?"

  england_dockers.5.d: "Portsmouth has risen. Armed workers' councils have seized dockyards, rail terminals, and municipal buildings. Red flags fly over the city as a ‘Provisional Committee of the South’ declares the birth of a new order.\n\nThe government has declared a state of emergency. Loyalist forces prepare to march. Britain teeters on the edge of civil war."

  # east indies
  england_east_indies.1.d: "In a bold declaration invoking 'historical stewardship' and 'strategic imperative', the British government has demanded control over several key territories in the East Indies.\n\nThe ultimatum, thinly veiled in diplomatic language, leaves little room for ambiguity: surrender the colonies — or face consequences.\n\nObservers wonder whether this is the assertion of an old empire’s right… or the ambitions of a new one."

  england_east_indies.2.d: "The colonial administration has agreed to transfer control of our contested East Indian territories to Britain.\n\nWhile the official communique cites 'regional stability' and 'cooperative transition', few doubt that the decision was made under duress. Across Asia and Europe, alarm is growing at Britain's return to gunboat diplomacy."

  england_east_indies.3.d: "The foreign government has rejected Britain’s demand to cede its East Indian holdings. In official statements, they assert that colonial extortion will not dictate international policy.\n\nIn Westminster, the move is viewed as a direct challenge. The press speaks of betrayal. The Admiralty draws up plans.\n\nThe Empire, it seems, still has teeth — and intends to bare them."

  # imperial wireless scandal
  england_wireless.1.d: "What began as a bold Admiralty-backed initiative to modernize Britain’s wireless infrastructure has taken a darker turn. Reports now suggest that 'Imperial Wireless', the private firm at the heart of the project, has received enormous government subsidies for investments that never materialized.\n\nThe press smells blood. Parliament demands answers. But the question remains — will anyone be held accountable?"

  england_wireless.2.d: "A brief investigation has confirmed what many feared: the Admiralty’s wireless modernization program was riddled with mismanagement, inflated contracts, and opaque deals.\n\nThough no criminal charges have been filed, several senior figures have quietly resigned. The program has been suspended indefinitely, and confidence in military procurement — and the government’s judgment — has taken a hit."

  # transvaal
  england_transvaal.1.d: "A suspicious fire has engulfed several administrative buildings in Bloemfontein, stoking tensions across the Transvaal. While no group has claimed responsibility, local authorities suspect Boer nationalists.\n\nThe arson attack has emboldened resistance groups, and British officials are divided — should they crack down swiftly or risk letting unrest spread in hopes it subsides naturally?"

  england_transvaal.2.d: "Open rebellion has erupted in the Transvaal, with Boer militias seizing arms and attacking British outposts. What began as isolated resistance has now grown into a coordinated uprising, driven by years of simmering resentment and the recent failure to pacify local unrest.\n\nLondon must now decide how to respond to this growing threat to imperial control in South Africa."

  # white feathers
  england_white_feathers.1.d: "As the war grinds on and hardship deepens, a new force stirs at home: women take to the streets, pressing white feathers into the hands of men not in uniform. What began as a symbol of courage’s absence now fuels division, shame, and despair.\n\nThe government faces a choice — allow the movement to run its course, or temper its fervor before the nation’s spirit is further torn."

  england_white_feathers.2.d: "News spreads across the country: a young veteran in Stockport has taken his own life after being publicly shamed with a white feather. Once hailed for his service, he became a victim of mistaken zeal.\n\nThe tragedy casts a dark shadow over the movement, and questions of honor, duty, and mercy echo in every corner of the land."
